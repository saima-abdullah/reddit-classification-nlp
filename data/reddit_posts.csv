1fufbfm,"I'm a Tech CEO at the Berlin Global Dialogue (w OpenAI, Emmanuel Macron) - Here's what you need to know about what's being said about AI/Tech behind closed doors - AMA","**Edit 3**: I think all done for now but I want to say a true thank you to everyone (and the to the mods for making this happen) for a discourse that was at least as valuable as the meeting I just left.. I’ll come back and answer any last questions tomorrow. If you want to talk more feel free to message me here or on ['x/twitter'](https://x.com/willsentance)

**Edit 2 (9pm in Berlin)**: Ok I’m taking a break for dinner - I'll be back later. I mostly use reddit for lego updates, I knew there was great discussion to be had, but yep it's still very satisfying to be part of it - keep sending questions/follow-ups!

**Edit (8pm in Berlin)** It says ""Just finished"" but I'm still fine to answer questions

Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/bYkUiE7](https://imgur.com/a/bYkUiE7) (thanks to r/technology mods for approving this AMA)

Right now, I’m at the Berlin Global Dialogue (https://www.berlinglobaldialogue.org/) – an exclusive event where the world’s top tech and business leaders are deciding how to shape the future. It’s like Davos, but with a sharper focus on tech and AI.

Who’s here? The VP of Global Impact at **OpenAI**, Herman Hauser (founder of **ARM**), and French President **Emmanuel** **Macron**. 

Here’s what you need to know:

* AI and machine learning are being treated like the next industrial revolution. One founder shared he'd laid off 300 people replaced with OpenAI's APIs (even the VP of at OpenAI appeared surprised)
* The conversations are heavily focused on how to control and monetize tech and AI – but there’s a glaring issue...
* ...everyone here is part of an insider leadership group - and many don't understand the tech they're speaking about (OpenAI does though - their tip was 'use our tech to understand' - that's good for them but not for all)

I’ve been coding for over a decade, teaching programming on Frontend Masters, and running an independent tech school, but what’s happening in these rooms is more critical than ever. If you work in tech, **get ready for AI/ML to completely change the game.** Every business will incorporate it, whether you’re prepared or not.

As someone raised by two public school teachers, I’m deeply invested in making sure the benefits of AI don’t stay locked behind corporate doors

I’m here all day at the BGD and will be answering your questions as I dive deeper into these conversations. Ask me anything about what’s really happening here.",1727873160.0,technology

6cvg82,Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

6h82ji,"PornHub, OK Cupid, Imgur, DuckDuckGo, Namecheap, Bittorrent, and a bunch of other big sites have joined the Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality on July 12 (Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, and Reddit were already on board.)","Hey reddit, I wanted to give a quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** that lots of us are planning for July 12th.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",1497452786.0,technology

7779es,The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. This could be the last chance for Internet users to make their voices heard.,"Hey reddit, I wanted to give everyone a heads up that Ajit Pai, former Verizon lawyer and current chairman of the FCC, is expected to circulate the text of his rule and announce a vote to gut net neutrality protections on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving.

**[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22. 

**There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com**

**We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**

Our best shot at saving net neutrality is if we can get phones ringing off the hook in Washington, DC right NOW. It's a long shot, but it's our best shot. Please spread the word, and message me if you want to learn more or get involved. ",1508340192.0,technology

6e8wta,Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well,"FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)
* Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811)
* Sen. John Thune (R-SD)  (Twitter: [@johnthune](https://twitter.com/johnthune); phone: 202-224-2321)
* Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS)  (Twitter: [@RogerWicker](https://twitter.com/rogerwicker); phone: 202-224-6253)
* Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Twitter: [@SpeakerRyan](https://twitter.com/speakerryan); phone: 202-225-3031)
* Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)  (Twitter: [@CathyMcMorris](https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris); phone: 202-225-2006)
* Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA)  (Twitter: [@RepTomGraves](https://twitter.com/reptomgraves); phone: 202-225-5211)
* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

867jo1,The CLOUD Act would let cops get our data directly from big tech companies like Facebook without needing a warrant. Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package.,"Congress just attached the CLOUD Act to the 2,232 page, must-pass [omnibus package](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf). It's on page 2,201.

The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant. It would even let foreign governments wiretap inside the U.S. without having to comply with U.S. Wiretap Act restrictions.

Major tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oath are [supporting](https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2018/02/Tech-Companies-Letter-of-Support-for-Senate-CLOUD-Act-020618.pdf) the bill because it makes their lives easier by relinquishing their responsibility to protect their users’ data from cops. And they’ve been throwing their lobby power behind getting the CLOUD Act attached to the omnibus government spending bill. 

Read more about the CLOUD Act from EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), and the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) and [here](https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-cloud-act).

fkzfzq,Reject the anti-encryption bill. These Senators are trying to damage privacy &amp; security while everyone is distracted with Coronavirus! EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators.,"[**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

While  the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have  been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security.

Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be  read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle  such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d  lose  legal protections that allow them to operate.

[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

That’s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security)   away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,”   meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney   General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban   encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message. This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies.

The EARN IT bill had  its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters’  strategy is clear. Because  they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to  insist it doesn’t affect encryption.

“This  bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said  at today’s hearing. “Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness.

It’s  true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption.  It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by  the  Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\]   what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law   enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.

You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.

The  19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of   best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.

The Commission won’t be a  body that seriously considers policy; it  will be a vehicle for creating  a law enforcement wish list. Barr has  made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once   it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as   they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not   just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those   governments want to suppress. 

The  privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law  enforcement  is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption.  Senators should  reject the EARN IT bill.

Self Explanatory. Aside from the fact that we pay per MB, and already share a slow connection, if a forced upgrade happened and crashed our pc's while in the middle of coordinating rangers under fire from armed militarized poachers.. blood could literally be on MS's hands. I just came here recently to act as their pilot.. but have IT skills as well. The guy who set these pc's up didn't know how to prevent it, or set a metered connection. I am completely livid.

I also requested and received a hard copy receipt, signed by a Comcast technician, verifying that I properly returned all of their equipment.

Every single step of my Comcast Equipment Return process is well documented [HERE] (http://www.buzzfeed.com/dannfuria/definitive-proof-it-is-impossible-to-avoid-comcast-wji6) and includes yet another Comcast audio recording.

Comcast additionally slammed me with a $960 Termination Fee for closing my account.

Due to an enormity of issues with my Comcast account and customer service, I began thoroughly documenting and recording my interactions with Comcast back in January of 2014.  My Comcast story has gotten a little bit of coverage by Gawker and The Verge in the past three days.

apu3oz,"With the recent Chinese company, Tencent, in the news about investing in Reddit, and possible censorship, it's amazing to me how so many people don't realize Reddit is already one of the most heavily censored websites on the internet.","I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&amp;#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit.

43fi39,I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for,"https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have &gt;500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.

EDIT 2: People asked for the source code. PLEASE USE THE CLEANED UP CODE BELOW. I am by no means some fancy programmer so there is no need to point out that my code is ugly or could be better. http://pastebin.com/WMEh802V 

EDIT 3: Please consider using the code some folks put together to improve on mine (people who actually program.) One example: https://github.com/james-atkinson/speedcomplainer",1454182017.0,technology

6ivklm,"Net neutrality day of action update: Twitter, Soundcloud, and Medium, have joined. Reddit, This could be as big as SOPA.","Hey reddit, I wanted to give another quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** planned for July 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and Internet users are helping organize.

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",1498157251.0,technology

2duzfi,Comcast’s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,"*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “Unreturned” equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast’s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast’s fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible &amp; overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, &amp; International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.

[Here's a screencapture for cellphone data plans in México](http://imgur.com/yYobj7x), which show how carriers basically discriminate data use based on which social network you browse/consume.

I wanted to post this here because I keep finding all these mockups about how Net Neutrality ""might look"" which -albeit correct in it's assumptions- get wrong the business model end of what companies would do with their power.

Basically, what the mockups show... a world where ""regular price for top companies vs pay an extra if you're a small company"", non-net neutral competition in México is actually based on who gives away more ""free app time"". Eg: ""You can order 3 Uber rides for free, no data use, with us!""

Which I guess makes more sense. The point is still the same though... ISPs are looking inside your data packets to make these content discrimination decisions.

144ffjp,/r/Gadgets will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit's new API policy,"###What's Going On? 

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

###What's The Plan?

On June 12th, [*many subreddits*](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1.	**Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2.	**Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.

3.	**Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4.	**Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",1686245289.0,gadgets
