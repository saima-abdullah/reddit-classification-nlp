I’ll come back and answer any last questions tomorrow. If you want to talk more feel free to message me here or on ['x/twitter'](https://x.com/willsentance)

**Edit 2 (9pm in Berlin)**: Ok I’m taking a break for dinner - I'll be back later. I mostly use reddit for lego updates, I knew there was great discussion to be had, but yep it's still very satisfying to be part of it - keep sending questions/follow-ups!

**Edit (8pm in Berlin)** It says ""Just finished"" but I'm still fine to answer questions

Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/bYkUiE7](https://imgur.com/a/bYkUiE7) (thanks to r/technology mods for approving this AMA)

Right now, I’m at the Berlin Global Dialogue (https://www.berlinglobaldialogue.org/) – an exclusive event where the world’s top tech and business leaders are deciding how to shape the future. It’s like Davos, but with a sharper focus on tech and AI.

Who’s here? The VP of Global Impact at **OpenAI**, Herman Hauser (founder of **ARM**), and French President **Emmanuel** **Macron**. 

Here’s what you need to know:

* AI and machine learning are being treated like the next industrial revolution. One founder shared he'd laid off 300 people replaced with OpenAI's APIs (even the VP of at OpenAI appeared surprised)
* The conversations are heavily focused on how to control and monetize tech and AI – but there’s a glaring issue...
* ...everyone here is part of an insider leadership group - and many don't understand the tech they're speaking about (OpenAI does though - their tip was 'use our tech to understand' - that's good for them but not for all)

I’ve been coding for over a decade, teaching programming on Frontend Masters, and running an independent tech school, but what’s happening in these rooms is more critical than ever. If you work in tech, **get ready for AI/ML to completely change the game.** Every business will incorporate it, whether you’re prepared or not.

As someone raised by two public school teachers, I’m deeply invested in making sure the benefits of AI don’t stay locked behind corporate doors

Ask me anything about what’s really happening here.",1727873160.0,technology,"['What use cases are the leaders seeing that are not apparent to the public?\n\nFrom my non technical old guy seat, it seems like image creation writing, maybe video and video games, animation loom great\n\nChatting about HR policies looks fine\n\nCreating crap content on websites seems fine\n\nI have not seen the other transformational use cases', ""Has anyone discussed liability for when AI costs lives or makes mistakes or how to handle disputes between consumers and AI that can't understand their concerns?\n\nHas anyone discussed the long term effects of over reliance on automation in content generation and the resulting loss of interest of consumers for products made by AI? \n\nHas anyone discussed how consumers are going to afford anything if they can't find work? \n\nDo people in that room really expect the majority of society to become masters and PhD level candidates to find work, rather than just take out their frustrations on government and corporations? \n\nBusiness leaders seem very hung ho about all this tech, but the average citizen appears frightened and mistrustful and anxious for their livelihood."", 'As someone who works with AI (VP R&amp;D at a medtech company) I don\'t think executives or investors have any idea of what to expect from AI technology.

1fxxmju,"Police seldom disclose use of facial recognition despite false arrests | A Post investigation found that many defendants were unaware of the technology’s role in linking them to crimes, leading to questions of fairness",,1728268857.0,technology,"['Breaking news : cops corrupt, lazy, stupid, completely free to take your life away with incompetence.', 'Some key points from this investigative piece:\n\n&gt;Police departments in 15 states provided The Post with rarely seen records documenting their use of facial recognition in more than 1,000 criminal investigations over the past four years. According to the arrest reports in those cases and interviews with people who were arrested, authorities routinely failed to inform defendants about their use of the software — denying them the opportunity to contest the results of an emerging technology that is prone to error, especially when identifying people of color.\n&gt;\n&gt;In fact, the records show that officers often obscured their reliance on the software in public-facing reports, saying that they identified suspects “through investigative means” or that a human source such as a witness or police officer made the initial identification.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Defense lawyers and civil rights groups argue that people have a right to know about any software that identifies them as part of a criminal investigation, especially a technology that has led to false arrests. The reliability of the tool has been successfully challenged in a handful of recent court cases around the country, leading some defense lawyers to posit that police and prosecutors are intentionally trying to shield the technology from court scrutiny.\n&gt;\n&gt;Police probably “want to avoid the litigation surrounding reliability of the technology,” said Cassie Granos, an assistant public defender in Minnesota. This year, one of her colleagues helped persuade a judge to exclude a facial recognition result from the state’s case against an alleged thief because, the judge ruled, the software does not “consistently produce accurate results.”\n&gt;\n&gt;Misidentification by this type of software played a role in the wrongful arrests of at least seven innocent Americans, six of whom were Black, according to police and court records reviewed by The Post and reports in other news outlets. Charges were later dismissed against all of them. Some were told during interrogations or in documents provided to their criminal defense lawyers that they had been identified by AI. Others learned about the software’s use only after officers mentioned in passing that “the computer” had found them, or that they had been a “positive match.”\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Federal testing of top facial recognition software has found the programs are more likely to misidentify people of color, women and the elderly because their faces tend to appear less frequently in data used to train the algorithms, according to Patrick Grother, who oversees biometric testing at the Washington-based National Institute of Standards and Technology. Roughly 2 million people of color and 2 million women are arrested in the United States each year, according to federal data.\n&gt;\n&gt;Clearview’s contracts with several police departments, obtained by The Post, say the program is not designed “as a single-source system for establishing the identity of an individual” and that “search results produced by the Clearview app are not intended nor permitted to be used as admissible evidence in a court of law or any court filing.”\n&gt;\n&gt;Prosecutors are required to inform defendants about any information that would help prove their innocence, reduce their sentence or hurt the credibility of a witness testifying against them. When prosecutors fail to disclose such information — known as a “Brady violation” after the 1963 Supreme Court ruling that mandates it — the court can declare a mistrial, overturn a conviction or even sanction the prosecutor.\n&gt;\n&gt;No federal laws regulate facial recognition and courts do not agree whether AI identifications are subject to Brady rules. Some states and cities have begun mandating greater transparency around the technology, but even in these locations, the technology is either not being used that often or it’s not being disclosed, according to interviews and public records requests.\n\nThis lack of disclosure for the use of these technologies is problematic at best, and especially so given the inaccuracies inherent in their algorithms and training data. Ideally systems that have these inaccuracies would not be deployed until these are remedied, but it seems that more often than not systems and services are rolled out with the expectation that the public will provide testing services, regardless of the broader consequences.', 'Well given that I can unlock my mom’s phone with my face, and I’m not even Asian. The technology still needs some time and work.', 'I would say it may be slightly better witness testimony. While a witness testimony may confuse themselves entirely on the person a AI identifier may mistake someone who looks like the suspect. Currently law is very behind technology advances and struggles to create new laws based on them.']"

It aims to address the restraints imposed by current technology, as the transmission of electric signals between chips is approaching its physical limit, the lab said.\n\nEstablished in 2021 with 8.2 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) in government funding, JFS is one of China\'s key institutions tasked with pursuing technological breakthroughs.\n\nMajor players in the global semiconductor industry have devoted resources into advancing silicon photonics, which is believed to hold the future to making better chips for data and graphics processing, as well as\xa0artificial intelligence (AI). Still, businesses have faced challenges in translating scientific breakthroughs into commercial products.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world\'s top contract chip maker, is one of the companies working on the technology. Its vice-president, Douglas Yu Chen-hua, last year said that a ""good silicon photonics integration system"" could address critical issues in energy efficiency and computing power in the AI era.\n\nThat development would bring about a ""paradigm shift"" in the industry, he said.\n\nUS chip design giants\xa0Nvidia\xa0and\xa0Intel, as well as China\'s\xa0Huawei Technologies, are also eyeing advances in silicon photonics. The global market for silicon photonics chips is expected to reach US$7.86 billion by 2030, up from US$1.26 billion in 2022, according to estimates by SEMI, an international semiconductor industry association.\n\nSilicon photonics may present an even bigger opportunity in China, where US export controls on advanced chip-making technologies have hindered the development of traditional semiconductors.\n\nSilicon photonics chips can be produced domestically using ""relatively mature raw materials and equipment"" without relying on high-end\xa0extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, unlike electrical chips, Sui Jun, president of Beijing-based semiconductor start-up Sintone, was quoted as saying by local media in 2022.\n\nEUV machines, required for making advanced chips, are considered the Achilles\' heel of the Chinese semiconductor industry, as domestic firms struggle to mass-produce such tools.

Is it just a generic term for fake images now?', 'The sheer fuckin’ irony of using ChatGPT to write a story about AI-generated images. You be the judge…\n\n&gt;The Problem with Fake Images During Disasters\n\n&gt;Repeated exposure to fake content can erode public trust in legitimate news and information sources. When people repeatedly encounter false images, they begin to question all media, including accurate and necessary disaster updates.\n\n&gt;Further, fake images can be a trojan horse for cyberattacks, often being shared in conjunction with phishing links or scam fundraising campaigns. Unsuspecting individuals are lured into contributing funds or providing personal details to malicious actors under the guise of helping those affected by disasters.\n\n&gt;The Psychological Toll of Fake Images\n\n&gt;The repeated exposure to fake content during disasters creates an emotional whiplash. People experience initial shock or sadness when they see images of devastation or distress, but when those images are debunked, it leads to feelings of betrayal, confusion or anger. This cycle can quickly wear down our ability to engage emotionally with real crises.\n\n&gt;The Exhaustion of Verification\n\n&gt;In the past, people could see an image of a disaster and instantly react, whether by donating, sharing it or sympathizing with those affected. Today, with so much misinformation floating around, even this simple act of caring comes with the extra step of verification.\n\n&gt;Before reacting, people now need to check if the image is real, where it comes from and whether it’s been manipulated. This constant mental effort adds a layer of fatigue, and many simply disengage, feeling it’s easier to not care than to wade through the sea of misinformation.\n\n&gt;The Desensitization Effect\n\n&gt;Every time a person learns that an image they were emotionally invested in is fake, it chips away at their compassion. People don’t like feeling duped, and once they’ve been misled a few times, they can begin to doubt everything they see.\n\n&gt;This skepticism makes it harder to summon genuine care during real disasters, as the fear of being fooled again overshadows the desire to help. Over time, they begin to tune out, treating every new disaster with a degree of emotional distance, unsure if it’s real or just another hoax.\n\n&gt;Too Much Effort to Believe\n\n&gt;Belief, particularly in times of crisis, should be simple. We should be able to see images and news reports of disasters and trust that they are accurate representations of what’s happening.\n\n&gt;However, the proliferation of fake images during events like Hurricane Helene has made this once-simple process far more complicated. A handful of bad actors can have an oversized impact by creating and sharing deepfakes that go viral.\n\n&gt;Fake Images Hurt Real People\n\n&gt;It now takes effort to decide whether to trust or engage with content. This effort can create problematic reactions that are detrimental to the individual and the collective.']"

That’s “particularly troubling,” according to the lawsuit, because federal regulators fined TransUnion $15 million last year for failing to ensure the accuracy of the tenant screening data it provided.\n&gt;\n&gt;As a result of the lack of quality control, RentGrow’s background reports for a tenant may incorrectly include arrest and eviction records for a different person who has the same name or may include records that are more than seven years old, which is prohibited by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, according to the lawsuit.\n\nNot surprising to see these companies do even less than the absolute minimum to ensure that their data is accurate.

Google would have to contract with every single building in NYC individually in order to roll out the service. Each building is considered its own jurisdiction and they have to invite a service like Google to come in and wire the building. Even then, most buildings require a majority vote by the residents to allow that since it could result in tenant costs.\n\nVerizon apparently suffered the same issues when they were pushing out Fios internet here. That's why the expansion was such a slow and ridiculous process in different parts of the city.\n\nThat and Verizon had no incentive because there was no real competition.\n\nIf we want Google Fiber to expand, we need to change the way internet infrastructure laws work in major cities.

But also...\n\n\n&lt;waves arms all around&gt;\xa0\n\n\nthere's unprecedented levels of all... this."", 'Very long article - Paywall Bypass: https://archive.ph/G3Kr1\n\n------------\n\nFirst few paragraphs\n\n&gt; Lori and Avery Schott wondered about the right age for their three children to have smartphones. For their youngest, Annalee, they settled on thirteen. They’d held her back in school a year, because she was small for her age and struggled academically. She’d been adopted from a Russian orphanage when she was two, and they thought that she might possibly have mild fetal alcohol syndrome. “Anna was very literal,” Lori told me when I visited the family home. “If you said, ‘Go jump in a lake,’ she’d go, ‘Why would he jump in the lake?’ ”\n&gt; \n&gt; When Anna was starting high school, the family moved from Minnesota to a ranch in eastern Colorado, and she seemed to thrive. She won prizes on the rodeo circuit, making friends easily. In her journal, she wrote that freshman year was “the best ever.” But in her sophomore year, Lori said, Anna became “distant and snarly and a little isolated from us.” She was constantly on her phone, which became a point of conflict. “I would make her put it upstairs at night,” Lori said. “She’d get angry at me.” Lori eventually peeked at Anna’s journal and was shocked by what she read. “It was like, ‘I’m not pretty. Nobody likes me. I don’t fit in,’ ” she recalled. Though Lori knew Anna would be furious at her for snooping, she confronted her. “We’re going to get you to talk to a counsellor,” she said. Lori searched in ever-widening circles to find a therapist with availability until she landed on someone in Boulder, more than two hours away. Anna resisted the idea, but once she started she was eager to keep going.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nonetheless, the conflicts between Anna and her parents continued. “A lot of it had to do with our fights over that stupid phone,” Lori said. Anna’s phone access became contingent on chores or homework, and Lori sometimes even took the phone to work with her. “I mean, she couldn’t walk the horse to the barn without it,” Lori said. Lori understood that the phone had become a place where her daughter sought validation and community. “She’d post something, and she’d chirp, ‘Oh, I got ten likes,’ ” she recalled. Lori asked her daughters-in-law to keep an eye on Anna’s Instagram, but Anna must have realized, because she set up four secret accounts. And, though Lori forbade TikTok, Anna had figured out how to hide the app behind a misleading icon.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Anna grew older, she became somewhat isolated socially. At school, jocks reigned and some kids had started drinking, but Anna was straitlaced and not involved in team sports. Still, there was good news. Early in her senior year, in the fall of 2020, she landed the lead in the school play and was offered a college rodeo scholarship. “But anxiety and depression were just engulfing her,” Lori said. Like many teen-age girls using social media, she had become convinced that she was ugly—to the point where she discounted visual evidence to the contrary. “When she saw proofs of her senior pictures, she goes, ‘Oh, my gosh, this isn’t me. I’m not this pretty.’ ” In her journal, she wrote, “Nobody is going to love me unless I ‘look the part.’ I look at other girls’ profiles and it makes me feel worse. Nobody will love someone who’s as ugly and as broken as me.”\n\n&gt; Because senior year was unfolding amid the disruptions of the COVID pandemic and everyone was living much of their lives online, her parents decided to be more lenient about Anna’s phone use. Soon, she was spending much of the night on social media and saying she couldn’t sleep. Shortly before Thanksgiving, Lori and Avery went to Texas to visit their eldest son, Cameron, and his wife and young son. Anna was going to go, too, but changed her mind because of the risk of getting COVID close to the play’s opening night. Rather than leave her alone, Anna’s parents had her stay with her other brother, Caleb, who was nine years older and lived near the family ranch with his wife.\n\n&gt; In Texas, there was happy news: another grandchild was on the way. During a family FaceTime on Sunday, November 15th, Anna seemed thrilled at becoming an aunt for the second time. Afterward, she went to the ranch to check on the chickens. Caleb’s wife asked if she’d be back for dinner, but Anna said she’d stay put, given that her parents would return that night.\n\n&gt; Lori and Avery were driving back to Colorado when a neighbor’s number popped up on Lori’s phone. She didn’t answer until the second call. The neighbor was too upset to say what had happened. Lori asked about Anna, and the neighbor kept repeating, “I’m sorry.” It turned out that she’d heard from a teacher whom Anna had phoned in distress and, when the neighbor went to check on Anna, she discovered that she’d shot herself. Now a sheriff’s deputy had arrived. Avery got him on the phone and asked, “Just tell us, is she alive?” The deputy replied, “No.” The Schotts drove on in terrible silence. As they crossed the prairie, a shooting star fell straight ahead of them.\n\n&gt; Anna was buried on a hill at the family ranch. One of the rodeo cowboys brought a wagon to carry her ashes, and thirty other cowboys rode behind her. The ceremony has been viewed online more than sixteen thousand times. “So you know she made an impact,” Lori said.\n\n&gt;Several months later, Lori heard from Cameron, who had read about the congressional testimony of a former product manager at Facebook named Frances Haugen. Haugen, who also released thousands of the company’s internal documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to the Wall Street Journal, claimed that the company knew about the harmful effects of social media on mental health but consistently chose “profit over safety.” (Meta—the parent company of Facebook and Instagram—has disputed Haugen’s claims.) Until Lori watched the testimony, she hadn’t really considered the role of social media in Anna’s troubles. “I was too busy blaming myself,” she recalled.\n\n&gt;Lori began delving into Anna’s social-media accounts. “I thought I’d see funny cat videos,” she said. Instead, the feeds were full of material about suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders: “It was like, ‘I hope death is like being carried to your bedroom when you were a child.’ ” Anna had told a friend about a live-streamed suicide she had viewed on TikTok. “We have to get off social media,” she’d said. “This is really horrible.” But she couldn’t quit. A friend of Anna’s also told Lori that Anna had become fixated on the idea that, if her parents knew how disturbed she was, she’d be hospitalized against her will. That prospect terrified her.\n\n&gt;Lori soon learned that other parents were suing tech companies and lobbying federal and state governments for better regulation of social media. Eventually she decided to do the same. “It takes litigation to pull back the curtain,” she explained. “I want those companies to be accountable. I don’t care about the money—I want transformation.”\n\n&gt;Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed in relation to social-media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. Families are not the only plaintiffs. Last year, Seattle’s public-school district sued multiple social-media companies alleging harm to its students and a resulting strain on district resources. Attorneys general for forty-one states and the District of Columbia have sued Meta for harming children by fuelling social-media addiction. Both the United Kingdom and the European Union have recently enacted legislation that heightens companies’ responsibility for content on their platforms, and there is bipartisan support for similar measures in the United States. The surgeon general, Vivek H. Murthy, has called for a warning label on social-media platforms, stating that they are “associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents.”\n\n&gt;Still, research paints a complex picture of the role of technology in emotional states, and restricting teens’ social-media use could cause harms of its own. Research accrues slowly, whereas technology and its uses are evolving faster than anyone can fully keep up with. Caught between the two, will the law be able to devise an effective response to the crisis?', 'Noticed that the article mentioned Beeban Kidron who has pushed for KOSA along with Senator Blumenthal who has a long history of “think of the children” legislation that ends up being highly controversial.\n\nA lot of KOSA style laws have been struck down left and right this year in courts due to those laws easily violating the 1st amendment.\n\nI don’t expect KOSA to pass this year due to election year and the House doesn’t seem to be entirely on board to push KOSA through either.', 'I would add that our ultra processed food diet is not doing us any favours either.

1ft0cei,Reddit is making sitewide protests basically impossible,,1727715000.0,technology,"['Here’s the text, so you can avoid giving literally 600 adtech vendors your private information, and that’s if you restrict the data collection to the bare minimum allowed. \n\n—————\n\nReddit is giving its staff a lot more power over the communities on its platform. Starting today, Reddit moderators will not be able to change if their subreddit is public or private without first submitting a request to a Reddit admin. The policy applies to adjusting all community types, meaning moderators will have to request to make a switch from safe for work to not safe for work, too.\n\nBy requiring admin approval for the changes, Reddit is taking away a lever many communities used to protest the company’s API pricing changes last year. By going private, the community becomes inaccessible to the public, making the platform less usable for the average visitor. And that’s part of the reason behind the change.\n\n“The ability to instantly change Community Type settings has been used to break the platform and violate our rules,” Reddit VP of community Laura Nestler, who goes by the username Go_JasonWaterfalls on the platform, writes in a post on r/modnews. “We have a responsibility to protect Reddit and ensure its long-term health, and we cannot allow actions that deliberately cause harm.”\n\nLast year, thousands of subreddits went private to protest changes to Reddit’s API pricing that forced some apps and communities to shut down. Going private was effective during the protests in making a statement and raising awareness. But it also blocked off content that Reddit users might have made with the expectation that it would stay public. (Going private made Google searches worse, too.)\n\nDuring the protests, Reddit sent messages to moderators of protesting communities to tell them that it would remove them from their posts unless they reopened their subreddits. It also publicly noted that going NSFW (Not Safe For Work), a tool moderators used to add friction to accessing a subreddit and to make the subreddit ineligible for advertising, was “not acceptable.”\n\nMore than a year after the protests, Reddit is essentially back to normal. But it appears the company still feels it has to make changes to protect the platform.\n\n“While we are making this change to ensure users’ expectations regarding a community’s access do not suddenly change, protest is allowed on Reddit,” writes Nestler. “We want to hear from you when you think Reddit is making decisions that are not in your communities’ best interests. But if a protest crosses the line into harming redditors and Reddit, we’ll step in.”\n\nReddit says it will review requests to make communities private or NSFW within 24 hours. For smaller or newer communities — under 5,000 members or less than 30 days old — requests will be approved automatically. And if a community wants to temporarily restrict posts or comments for up to seven days, which might be useful for a sudden influx of traffic or when mod teams want to take a break, they can do so without approval with the “temporary events” feature.\n\nA GIF showing how to make a Community Type request on Reddit.\nGIF: Redditnormal\n\nReddit worked with mods ahead of announcing this change, Nestler tells me in an interview. The same day Nestler and I talked, for example, she said that she had spoken about the changes with Reddit’s mod council, which has about 160 moderators.\n\nShe characterized their reaction as “broadly measured” and said that the mods understand Reddit’s rules and why Reddit is making the change, “even if they don’t necessarily like it.” But “the feedback that was very obvious was this will be interpreted as a punitive change,” particularly in response to last year’s API protests, she says.\n\nI asked if Reddit would reconsider this new requirement if there was significant blowback. “We’re going to move forward with it,” Nestler says. “We believe that it’s needed to keep communities accessible. That’s why we’re doing this.”\n\nNestler says the change is something that the company has talked about since she came to Reddit (she joined in March 2021, two years before the protests). But the protests made it clear that letting moderators make their communities private at their discretion “could be used to harm Reddit at scale” and that work on this feature was “accelerated” because of the protests.\n\nNestler wanted to make clear that its rules aren’t new and that the enforcement of the rules isn’t new. “Our responsibility is to protect Reddit and to ensure its long-term health,” Nestler says. “After that experience, we decided to deprecate a way to cause harm at scale.” However, she says that the company only did so “when we were confident that we could bring our mods along with us.”', 'People still use Reddit?\n\n*looks down at my own hands*\n\nAhh!', '&gt;“The ability to instantly change Community Type settings has been used to break the platform and violate our rules,”\n\nWhat rules does it break?']"

It also didn't have any specialty cable packages of HBO or Showtime or anything like that. However it was maxed out for the most part. The scary part is is that there was another tier above it that did not include those additional add-ons. That's a lot of money for cable and we didn't even watch it that much. I am embarrassed to say that I was paying that much and not using it. \n\nA lot of people that have DirecTV. I assume we're probably in the same boat as me that they really don't use it that much but they pay the bill and my transition was actually seamless. \n\nI decided to wean myself off of DirecTV while I still had it. That way. If I missed any shows or anything I could still watch it but I figured out how to watch all my favorite shows via apps and subscriptions and not miss anything. \n\nOne of the more difficult things was sports. If you're a sports fan it's going to take some some getting used to because it's all over the place. However, ESPN plus had me covered for a lot of the stuff that I wanted. I also watched local teams so I was able to get those via the CBS app. \n\nIt's super convenient to just use a remote control and churn to the channel you want. It's also great to use a DVR. However, when you miss those shows you are in trouble. Sometimes you can see him again on demand and sometimes you just miss them. \n\nNow with streaming it's always there when you want it. Not when the TV tells you to watch it. Yes, I know we've had DVR for decades but it was never perfect. Now you don't have to worry about that and I think I have a greater select than I've ever had for TV. I don't miss paying the money I did for DirecTV. \n\nI am so surprised that DirecTV did not see the writing on the wall. The guys over at AT&amp;T just love to burn through money and this was a colossal waste of money when they bought DirecTV. I didn't think they could make it worse but they sure did. This is a mobile company and they had to see the subscription service blowing up because that's exactly what mobile phone service is subscriptions. They just chose to put their head in the sand and blow shareholders money and have the customers pay for it. Hopefully the people that take over DirecTV will have some better plans for it and turn it into something competitive. However, I think it's just like cable, satellite TV is destined for death.""]"

1ftyiws,Technological Advances Drive Solar Heater Market Growth,,1727815263.0,technology,"['Solar-powered heating systems are becoming more popular as governments encourage a transition away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives and consumers look for ways to reduce their utility bills. Just like residential solar panels that provide consumers with electricity, solar heaters are being installed in homes around the globe as part of government initiatives as well as privately. \n\nSolar water heating systems include a storage tank and a solar collector. There are two types of systems available: active, which have circulating pumps and controls, and passive, which do not. There are two types of active solar water heating systems: direct circulation systems, which have pumps that circulate household water through the collectors and into the home and indirect circulation systems, which have pumps that circulate non-freezing, heat-transfer fluid through the collectors and a heat exchanger, heating the water that flows into the home. The latter works more effectively in cold climates than the former.\n\n  \nPassive solar water heating systems are generally less expensive than active systems, although not as efficient. However, they can be more reliable and last longer. There are also two basic types of passive systems. The Integral collector-storage passive system has a storage tank covered with a transparent material, which allows the sun to heat the water before delivering it to the plumbing system. Thermosyphon systems work by heating water in a collector on the roof before transporting it to the plumbing system when a hot water faucet is opened. Most of these systems have a 40-gallon capacity.  \n\nAs they rely on solar power, these systems typically require a backup system for cloudy days and times of high demand. Backups can come in the form of conventional storage water heaters or as part of the solar collector, such as rooftop tanks with thermosyphon systems. Solar water heaters need to be maintained every three to five years and some parts may need replacing every two to 10 years. Once installed, they can massively reduce consumer utility bills, particularly in regions with greater solar irradiance.']"

(NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) and Vertical Bridge today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for Vertical Bridge to obtain the exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage 6,339 wireless communications towers across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. from subsidiaries of Verizon for approximately $3.3 billion, including certain commercial benefits. The transaction is structured as a prepaid lease with upfront proceeds of approximately $2.8 billion in cash.\n\n&gt; Under the terms, Verizon will enter into a 10-year agreement1 to lease back capacity on the towers from Vertical Bridge, serving as the anchor tenant, with options that could extend the lease term up to 50 years. Verizon will also have access to certain additional space on the towers for its future use, subject to certain restrictions. This agreement, along with Verizon’s existing build-to-suit joint venture with Vertical Bridge, will support Verizon’s efforts to drive down tower-related costs and provide greater vendor diversity in a concentrated industry. \n\n&gt; “As the nation’s largest mobility provider, we are well positioned with greater financial flexibility to invest in our business, return value to our shareholders and make the nation’s best network even better for customers,” said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. “This transaction builds on our existing relationship with Vertical Bridge while realizing substantial value for this unique set of assets and allows us to be agile in optimizing the network with one of the best operating partners.” \n\n&gt; ""We are pleased to have been selected by Verizon as the counterparty in the largest US tower transaction in almost a decade,"" said Ron Bizick, President and CEO of Vertical Bridge. ""This transaction represents a significant step for Vertical Bridge. The vision of the company founders 10 years ago was to create a permanent, private, and at-scale US tower company. This transaction marks a significant milestone in the realization of that vision. Upon the completion of this transaction, these assets, together with our existing portfolio which includes thousands of young, purpose-built towers, enhance Vertical Bridge’s position as a fast, friendly, and flexible colocation partner to the wireless industry.”\n\n&gt; “Since co-founding Vertical Bridge in 2014, we’ve been on a transformative journey, and this landmark transaction with Verizon Communications marks an inflection point in that evolution,” said Marc Ganzi, CEO of DigitalBridge and Vice Chairman of Vertical Bridge. “This transaction not only solidifies our leadership in the tower space but also strategically positions us to capitalize on the growing demand for wireless infrastructure, especially as AI-driven technologies and 5G continue to reshape connectivity needs across industries.""\n\n&gt; DigitalBridge, a leading global alternative asset manager dedicated to investing in digital infrastructure and majority owner of Vertical Bridge, has committed capital to support the transaction.\n\n&gt; CDPQ, a global investment group and an important shareholder of Vertical Bridge since 2019, also committed capital to finance this transaction.\n\n&gt; The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\n&gt; J.P. Morgan acted as financial advisor to Verizon and Jones Day acted as legal counsel. Centerview Partners LLC served as financial advisor to Vertical Bridge and Greenberg Traurig acted as legal counsel.

Lastly, I provide a few reasons why everyone should care about this project.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Axel Voss is one of the lead architects of the GDPR. He is a member of the European Parliament and authored the 2011 initiative report titled “Comprehensive Approach to Personal Data Protection in the EU” when he was the European Parliament's rapporteur. His call for action resulted in the development of the GDPR legislation. After observing the unfulfilled promises of the GDPR, Voss wrote a position paper highlighting the law's weaknesses.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;US authorities should take on the challenge of developing an improved privacy protection approach that would overcome the flaws of the GDPR.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;At first glance, it seems that only Big Tech companies should care about revamping the GDPR. After all, they are the ones getting huge fines. It is also understandable that some people might think Big Tech is getting what it deserves.\n&gt;\n&gt;My own complaint against Big Tech companies is that they have too much power and often exercise it in questionable or monopolistic ways. I am neither opposed to Big Tech companies nor to the EU in principle, but I would like to make sure that neither side can exert undue or arbitrary power.\n&gt;\n&gt;Most privacy professionals, company executives, and even data subjects are sensing that something needs to be changed about the current GDPR approach and enforcement. This change is less likely to come from the EU Parliament members. This is because the GDPR is still considered by many to be a fantastic achievement of the EU. What could likely bring some change is if a country like the US developed a different privacy approach that would bring choice and a new perspective into this important segment of protection of the privacy of data subjects. I hope that this piece contributes in some way to such an effort.\n\nThis author presents a set of points about the flaws of the GDPR and his proposals for an American version. From my lay perspective, his proposal primarily looks to water down some of the provisions of the GDPR, and put the responsibility of these protections back in the hands of private companies rather than the public, rather than the EU approach which centers the public over the private."", '&gt; Second, the law is based on the premise that data protection should be a fundamental right of EU persons. Hence, the stipulations are absolute and one-sided or laser-focused only on protecting the ""fundamental rights and freedoms"" of natural persons\n\nYeah, that\'s not a flaw, not even close to a flaw, in fact it\'s the basis of GDPR, it\'s its raison d\'être', 'Consumer privacy and (so-called) ""surveillance capitalism"" are fundamentally incompatible and inconsistent with the desires and avarice of US oligarchs/plutocrats.\n\n\nTherefore... this will obviously **never** realistically fly.\n\n\nWe collectively *live* in that dystopia now and no amount of flailing outrage by \'the ants\' will alter that (cause... ""shareholder value"").']"

Some experiments I've seen seems promising at least."", 'Portions from the article:\n\n&gt;For more than 70 years, humanity has been pursuing the dream of turning nuclear fusion (when the nuclei of two atoms fuse together, the opposite of fission, which separates them) into a source of energy that is expected to be safe, clean (it creates waste, but it is very manageable and it does not emit greenhouse gases) and almost inexhaustible: its main fuels are easily found in nature (for example, seawater as a source of deuterium atoms). But until that December night, when that tiny pellet exploded in the center of a vacuum chamber in California, no one had managed to generate a positive result, that is, produce more energy than was actually used to join the atoms.\n&gt;\n&gt;“It has been a turning point, it has given the world confidence that it is possible. It’s been like the Wright brothers’ experience [who in 1903 made the first controlled powered flight],” says Bruno Van Wonterghem, head of operations at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), the center of the large public complex in Livermore, California that is carrying out the fusion project.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;“For many years, progress has been slow, funding has been quite scarce, and people have been forced to do international collaborations, in part because no country could do it alone. So this wave of private investment is very welcome,” explains Davis. He continues: “Many of these new companies are not going to be able to keep their promises, but they can solve some specific problems. And if you have 10 companies and they all solve a problem, you know, that’s 10 fewer problems that put you closer to the goal.”\n&gt;\n&gt;But to better understand what problems we are talking about and how close or far away the objective may be, we should go back in history and understand some basic concepts. “What we want to achieve is to reproduce the reactions that take place in the Sun and stars. They work the same way: since they have a lot of mass, gravity forces the nuclei of their particles to fuse to give heavier elements: two hydrogens become one helium. And in this process a lot of energy is released, because a mass deficit is produced, that of Einstein’s famous equation: E=mc² [energy equals mass times the speed of light squared],” explains Isabel García Cortés, a scientist at the Fusion Laboratory of the Centre for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT), based in Madrid, which has hosted another of these research machines in this field, the TJ-II, since the 1990s. She continues: “The difficulty we have on Earth, obviously, lies in the fact that we do not have the gravity that the Sun has.”\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;With thousands of scientists working in universities and research centers around the world on each of the problems that remain to be solved, the pursuit for nuclear fusion is a strange story of both competition and collaboration. A race, after all, in which we would all be winners and which everyone appears to believe in.\n&gt;\n&gt;When asked for their predictions for the future, many of the scientists replied: “Fusion will come when we want it to come.” That is, when it is really needed and the resources are invested. The need for clean energy is more urgent than ever; the consequences of climate change are already being felt and it seems clear that more alternatives to fossil fuels are needed. By 2050, electricity demand is forecast to rise between 30% and 76% and renewables will not be able to meet all the demand.\n&gt;\n&gt;What is still not clear is what reactor will win the race, says José Manuel Perlado, president of the Guillermo Velarde Nuclear Fusion Institute at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. “In these races, it is not necessarily the best who wins,” he says. “For now there are many ideas on offer, nobody can tell you exactly where the issue will go in the end and the big energy companies are not going to risk investing until it is clearer.”\n&gt;\n&gt;If Livermore was a turning point on the road to nuclear fusion energy, the next, and surely definitive, will be the day when the major electricity companies start investing for real.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the progress in this sector in the years to come. Hopefully the technologies being developed will be broadly deployable and will be able to help communities the world over with their energy needs in a safe and affordable way.']"

The primary new idea there is foldable screens, which effectively allow your phone to turn into a tablet—though tablet sales have slowed too. The virtual-reality headsets that companies have spent billions developing aren’t being widely adopted.\n&gt;\n&gt;These companies are betting big that people want to be able to check the weather without pulling out a smartphone—and that they are more willing to wear a pair of Ray-Bans with cameras than spend hours in the metaverse. And after years of false starts on the glasses front, they’re betting that AI—despite some high-profile flops—will be what finally helps them achieve this vision.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Products such as Orion, which promise not just AI features but a full, seamless integration of the digital world into physical reality, face even steeper challenges. It’s really, really difficult to squish so many capabilities into eyewear that looks semi-normal. You need to be able to fit a battery, a camera, speakers, and processing chips all into a single device. Right now, even some of the most state-of-the-art glasses require you to be tethered to additional hardware to use them. According to The Verge’s Alex Heath, the Orion glasses require a wireless “compute puck” that can be no more than about 12 feet away from them—something Zuckerberg certainly did not mention onstage. Snap’s newest Spectacles, announced earlier this month, don’t require any extra hardware—but they have a battery life of only 45 minutes, and definitely still look big and clunky. The hardware problem has bedeviled generations of smart glasses, and there still isn’t a neat fix.\n&gt;\n&gt;But perhaps the biggest challenge facing this generation of smart glasses is neither hardware nor software. It’s philosophical. People are stressed right now about how thoroughly technology has seeped into our everyday interactions. They feel addicted to their phones. These companies are pitching smart glasses as a salve—proposing that they could, for example, allow you to handle a text message without interrupting quality time with your toddler. “Instead of having to pull out your phone, there will just be a little hologram,” Zuckerberg said of Orion during his presentation. “And with a few subtle gestures, you can reply without getting pulled away from the moment.”\n&gt;\n&gt;Yet committing to a world in which devices are worn on our face means committing to a world in which we might always be at least a little distracted. We could use them to quietly read our emails or scroll Instagram at a restaurant without our partner knowing. We could check our messages during a meeting while looking like we’re still paying attention. We may not need to check our phones so much, because our phones will effectively be connected to our eyeballs. Smart glasses walk a thin line between helping us be less obsessively on the internet and tethering us even more closely to it.\n\nGiven the current trend of people trying to un-tether themselves from their devices and from social networks (people switching to feature/dumb phones, using older digital cameras, etc) it seems interesting that companies are developing devices that will likely do the exact opposite, and tie us even more tightly to these tech ecosystems. Whether the purported conveniences will be enough to convince people who are already weary and wary of these technologies to embrace them remains to be seen.', ""Call me a pessimist, but am I alone in feeling not that excited by these developments? Like, is this all what we have to look forward to with technology? Smart glasses, self-driving cars, automation that's going to replace human workers, and AI being crammed into every product whether it needs it or not..?\n\nUninspired to say the least.""]"

California social media bill could totally reshape kids' online world,,1727618033.0,technology,"['This is an ambitious move by California, and it\'s likely to generate a lot of debate—and legal action—in the next few years. The idea of banning algorithmic feeds and enforcing chronological-only content for minors is a big change. Some thoughts:\n\n**Challenges and Unintended Consequences:**\n\n1. **Age Verification Issues**: One obvious challenge is the requirement for age verification. I mean, lol, I think it was harder to fake your age back in the 90s when you had to call up AOL and pretend to be your parent since I was too scared to talk on the phone.\n2. **Impact on User Experience**: Algorithmic feeds are often a source of entertainment tailored to an individual’s tastes, which keeps content relevant and interesting. Chronological feeds, in contrast, can feel random, less engaging, and sometimes overwhelming, as kids end up missing the curated feel. This could lead some minors to look for workarounds, potentially accessing other platforms without similar restrictions, and then we\'re back in this same circle of hell.\n3. **Pushback from Tech Companies**: Face it, they\'re going to use all the money in the world to try to fight this.\n\n**Some Potential Benefits, I suppose:**\n\n1. **Reducing Addictive Design**: I\'m spending my weekend on Reddit, and that\'s probably not good. Shouldn\'t we be helping anyone with a developing brain not spend their weekends here.\n2. **Protecting Sleep and Focus**: Kids often have a hard time resisting that notification ping—it\'s a dopamine hit that can lead to them losing sleep or becoming distracted when they should be focused on schoolwork. A restriction like this could encourage better sleep.\n3. **Encouraging Real-World Connections**: The bill also addresses the isolation aspect of social media. Chronological feeds of followed accounts can promote more direct and meaningful engagement with known friends, family, and selected creators, rather than an endless stream of algorithm-selected content, which often feeds users content from strangers and can make meaningful connections feel more distant.\n\nSB976 is a bold attempt to address the well-documented harms of social media use among minors, but its effectiveness will heavily depend on how it is implemented, enforced, and resisted. We need to consider whether such heavy regulation is practical in the long run or if this will lead to a digital whack-a-mole scenario, with kids finding new ways to circumvent these rules as they inevitably try to regain the type of content experience they\'re used to. Either way, this will be an interesting one to watch, as it might reshape not just TikTok, but probably every social network. It\'s not like they\'re going to say ""TikTok can\'t do this but Zuck can.""', ""Can I get my account classified as a kid's account so I can get chronological newsfeeds instead of engagement-pushing newsfeeds?"", 'TikTok needs to be banned, period']"

For about two decades now, since human-genome analysis became quick and common, the A’s, C’s, G’s, and T’s of DNA have allowed long-lost relatives to connect, revealed family secrets, and helped police catch serial killers. Some people’s genomes contain clues to what’s making them sick, or even, occasionally, how their disease should be treated. For most of us, though, consumer tests don’t have much to offer beyond a snapshot of our ancestors’ roots and confirmation of the traits we already know about. (Yes, 23andMe, my eyes are blue.) 23andMe is floundering in part because it hasn’t managed to prove the value of collecting all that sensitive, personal information. And potential buyers may have very different ideas about how to use the company’s DNA data to raise the company’s bottom line. This should concern anyone who has used the service.\n&gt;\n&gt;DNA might contain health information, but unlike a doctor’s office, 23andMe is not bound by the health-privacy law HIPAA. And the company’s privacy policies make clear that in the event of a merger or an acquisition, customer information is a salable asset. 23andMe promises to ask its customers’ permission before using their data for research or targeted advertising, but that doesn’t mean the next boss will do the same. It says so right there in the fine print: The company reserves the right to update its policies at any time. A spokesperson acknowledged to me this week that the company can’t fully guarantee the sanctity of customer data, but said in a statement that “any scenario which impacts our customer's data would need to be carefully considered. We take the privacy and trust of our customers very seriously, and would strive to maintain commitments outlined in our Privacy Statement.”\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Spelling out all the potential consequences of an unknown party accessing your DNA is impossible, because scientists’ understanding of the genome is still evolving. Imagine drugmakers trolling your genome to find out what ailments you’re at risk for and then targeting you with ads for drugs to treat them. “There’s a lot of ways that this data might be misused or used in a way that the consumers couldn’t anticipate when they first bought 23andMe,” Suzanne Bernstein, counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told me. And unlike a password that can be changed after it leaks, once your DNA is out in the wild, it’s out there for good.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;The risk of DNA data being misused has existed since DNA tests first became available. When customers opt in to participate in drug-development research, third parties already get access to their de-identified DNA data, which can in some cases be linked back to people’s identities after all. Plus, 23andMe has failed to protect its customers’ information in the past—it just agreed to pay $30 million to settle a lawsuit resulting from an October 2023 data breach. But for nearly two decades, the company had an incentive to keep its customers’ data private: 23andMe is a consumer-facing business, and to sell kits, it also needed to win trust. Whoever buys the company’s data may not operate under the same constraints.\n\nLeaving the details of how organizations manage sensitive data up to each of them is likely a bad idea, as we've been seeing in recent years. It's long past time that there were mandatory standards for all companies who collect sensitive data, along with significant punishment for those who are found in violation. This kind of protection or coverage should go with the person and their data, and the responsibilities and penalties should apply to any who might purchase or otherwise use the data."", '&gt;and anyone who has spit into one of the company’s test tubes should be concerned\n\nalso their close relatives']"

If they want our data, they should first, be required to request permission. Second, they should be paying US for use of that data, if permission has been granted. Using our data without permission should be punishable by federal law, and appropriate disciplinary action taken. And by appropriate, I mean fines so high, that violating the law would be financially devastating. \n\nThey are using something that doesn’t belong to them, to enrich themselves. It’s crazy, and unfathomable that it’s gotten to this point. \n\nBig Tech is rushing AI because they know that eventually, the tide of consumer privacy will change. It’s already happening in other countries. They want to vacuum up every bit of data they can for use with their AI models, before doing so is unlawful. By the time our government gets in front of this, it will be far too late. \n\nAI should have never been released into the wild before safeguards were put in place, and legislation regarding its proper use implemented.

It looked like a bit of duper’s delight… \n\nFurther, I’d argue that tech companies relying on third parties for their scan database is an extreme risk to privacy. \n\nSimilar to how construct companies employ third parties to source their laborforce with undocumented workers, when the companies building the property are caught - they simply blame it on the third party and keep the whole project running with **another** third party. Rinse and repeat. \n\nI have a suspicion that this is what these Ai companies are doing. Scraping massive scan databases and using the data in a way that the person that was originally scanned did not agree to. When they’re caught - they’ll throw that party under the bus and do the same thing with another third party. Rinse and repeat. \n\nThey couldn’t even say WHERE they get it.

Get out at $13/sh rather than the $1/sh it will be very soon.', '&gt; United Atlantic Ventures LLC, a major shareholder in Trump Media, has sold or otherwise gotten rid of more than 7.5 million shares in the company, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.\n\n&gt; The move left UAV, a partnership of former “Apprentice” contestants Andrew Litinsky and Wes Moss, owning just 100 shares in Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app.\n\n&gt; The amount of money UAV got from the stock sales, which occurred within the past week, was not disclosed.\n\n&gt; But the price range that DJT shares has traded at during that time – which saw unusually heavy trading volume — suggests that UAV would have received between $128 million and $170 million for its stock.\n\n&gt; UAV was allowed to sell any of its 5.4% stake in DJT’s outstanding shares after a lock-up agreement that had barred company insiders from selling expired on Sept. 19.\n\n&gt; UAV is the only known insider to sell off shares after that day.\n\n&gt; Litinsky and Moss had pitched the idea of a social media company to former President Donald Trump, and co-founded the company with him in 2021. The duo later fell out with Trump, and have been embroiled in lawsuits over their shares since then.\n\n&gt; Trump owns more than 56% of Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT on the Nasdaq. The stock closed at $13.98 per share on Thursday.\n\n&gt; Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that UAV owned 7,525,000 shares of Trump Media as of March 25, the day the company completed a merger with the blank-check company Digital World Acquisition Corp.\n\n&gt; After UAV’s sale of its stake, the only other entity that holds more than 5% of Trump Media shares is ARC Global Investments II LLC, which holds slightly more than 11 million shares.\n\n&gt; UAV later was awarded another 3.44 million shares that were issued “for no additional consideration based on the performance of our shares of Common Stock,” Trump Media said in an SEC filing on Sept. 5.\n\n&gt; That left UAV owning more than 10.96 million shares.\n\n&gt; Thursday’s SEC filing does not say when UAV shed its shares in the past week, and at what price or prices it received for that stock.\n\n&gt; But DJT has traded at prices between $15.50 per share and $11.75 in that period. That suggests UAV would have received between $128 million and $170 million for the shares it appears to have sold.\n\n&gt; Trump Media had warned in a Florida lawsuit against UAV that the company was planning to sell “all of its shares as soon as possible” once the lockup expired.\n\n&gt; UAV’s disclosure of the sale in a 13G filing with the SEC came on the heels of a Sept. 6 ruling by a federal judge in Delaware in UAV’s favor in a lawsuit against a securities transfer agent, Odyssey Transfer and Trust Company.\n\n&gt; That ruling barred Odyssey from interfering with the transfer of UAV’s Trump Media shares to UAV when the lock-up period expired.\n\n&gt; Odyssey had indicated before the ruling that it would take directions from Trump Media on the transfer of share, and Trump Media had refused to say if it would allow Odyssey to remove transfer restrictions without preference to any shareholder.\n\n&gt; Trump Media stock soared in its trading debut on the Nasdaq, reaching an intraday high of $79.38 per share and sending the company’s market capitalization north of $10 billion.\n\n&gt; But DJT’s price quickly pulled back.\n\n&gt; In recent months it has suffered a downward slide that erased more than 80% of the company’s value at its post-merger peak. The company’s market cap is now below $2.8 billion.\n\n&gt; Analysts view DJT as a meme stock whose wild price swings were driven more by investors’ support for Trump, the majority shareholder and Truth Social’s main draw, than its business fundamentals.\n\n&gt; Trump Media has reported net losses of around $344 million on revenues of less than $2 million in its last two quarterly earnings reports.', 'Ah, the first rat off the sinking ship.', ""Who the fuck bought all those shares for $100m+?!?!?

No injuries were reported to the 161 passengers and crew.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As part of the probe, NTSB investigators tested one of the rudder control components from the airplane, known as a rollout guidance actuator. After testing the actuator and an identical unit from another airplane in a cold environment, they found both had “significantly compromised” ability to function, including excessive moisture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Collins Aerospace, which manufactured the component, later determined that a sealed bearing was incorrectly assembled during production, leaving the unsealed side more “susceptible to moisture that can freeze and limit rudder system movement.” Collins notified Boeing that more than 353 actuators the company had delivered to Boeing since February 2017 were affected. The rudder system is critical because it helps pilots maneuver the aircraft.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;In statements, the FAA said it will convene a corrective action review board to determine next steps, while Collins Aerospace said it will continue to work closely with the NTSB and Boeing on the investigation and support Boeing and aircraft operators in mitigating operational impacts.\n\nBoeing, already suffering from a variety of issues in recent months, appears to be having yet more issues with their planes and systems, thanks in part to mistakes made by subcontractors. At this point, it's pretty clear that these issues are symptoms of a more significant problem at the company, and will likely continue until these systemic issues are fixed.

Google Maps will also look for reviews that attempt to manipulate ratings by posting from multiple accounts, or utilize emulators, modified operating systems, or other methods that “mimic genuine engagement.”\n&gt;\n&gt;It’s unclear how Google will accurately determine which reviews violate these rules, but the threat of being publicly shamed may be enough to deter some businesses from trying to artificially inflate their ratings. The warning message can also help users avoid visiting places Google deems untrustworthy, instead of suspicious reviews simply vanishing without explanation.\n\nThe devil will be in the details, but broadly speaking this is long past due.

Cardin, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, renewing fears that lawmakers could become the targets of malign actors seeking to influence U.S. politics or to obtain sensitive information.\n\nAccording to an emailed warning sent by Senate security officials to lawmakers’ offices and obtained by The New York Times, a senator’s office received an email last Thursday that appeared to be from Dmytro Kuleba, until recently Ukraine’s foreign minister, requesting to connect over Zoom. On the subsequent video call, the person looked and sounded like Mr. Kuleba.\n\nBut the senator grew suspicious when the figure posing as Mr. Kuleba started acting out of character, the Senate security officials wrote, asking “politically charged questions in relation to the upcoming election” and demanding an opinion on sensitive foreign policy questions, such as whether the senator supported firing long-range missiles into Russian territory. The senator ended the call and reported it to State Department authorities, who confirmed that the figure who appeared to be Mr. Kuleba was an impersonation.\n\nThough the Senate security office’s email did not specify that the senator was Mr. Cardin, two Senate officials familiar with the matter confirmed that he was the senator in question.\n\nMr. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, also partially confirmed the episode in a statement Wednesday night. In it, he acknowledged that “in recent days, a malign actor engaged in a deceptive attempt to have a conversation with me by posing as a known individual.” Mr. Cardin did not say the individual was Mr. Kuleba or make any reference to Ukraine.\n\nThe operation was reported earlier by Punchbowl News.\n\nDeepfake video technology uses artificial intelligence to create video of fictitious people who look and sound real. The technology has sometimes been used to impersonate public figures, including a video that circulated on social media in 2022 falsely showing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine announcing a surrender in the war with Russia.\n\nMr. Cardin is retiring at the end of the year. But the episode has renewed fears that foreign actors could try to target lawmakers, particularly now in a bid to influence the outcome of the November election.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who had orchestrated the operation that targeted Mr. Cardin. Intelligence officials have warned that foreign actors such as Russia, Iran and China are exploiting artificial intelligence, including deepfakes, to augment their election interference efforts — with Russia generating the most content, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said this week.\n\n\n\nWhile it is unclear if Russia was behind the impersonation of Mr. Kuleba, some of the questions asked of Mr. Cardin would be of particular interest to Russia — particularly when, according to the Senate security office’s email, the impersonator asked him: “Do you support long-range missiles into Russian territory? I need to know your answer.”\n\nSenate security officials cautioned lawmakers to remain vigilant.\n\n“While we have seen an increase of social engineering threats in the last several months and years, this attempt stands out due to its technical sophistication and believability,” the email from the Senate’s security office said, adding that “it is likely that other attempts will be made in the coming weeks.”', ""Thats crazy, interesting that it only went on to be reported because he sensed they seemed out of character. Imagine how many Republicans might have had similar calls but figured this wasn't out of character""]"

Interacting with certain financial institutions that are subject to KYC laws, ordering alcohol at the store or online, certain industries subject to age-restriction laws, onboarding remotely to a new job. In the old days, if you wanted them to authenticate you, you had nothing better to do than to than to send them a photo of your driver\'s license. But this gave away a whole lot of information (where you live, for example), and you had no idea how they would store that insecure photo. In all likelihood, they would store it insecurely and indefinitely, and it would get leaked in a data breach later on. If those photos were leaked, or your physical driver\'s license was lost or stolen, your identity is easily stolen.\n\nNow, in those situations where the service provider has a legitimate interest in verifying your identity and you do consent to having your identity verified, you have a more secure option, based on robustly designed cryptosystems, so that only the relevant info you\'ve consented to (""This website is requesting to verify x y and z attributes of your government ID. Proceed?"") is securely communicated in a one-time manner. And unlike losing your physical driver\'s license, if your phone is lost, you can wipe it, and just like your credit cards stored in Apple or Google Wallet, it can\'t be used anyway without the phone holder authenticating with biometrics.\n\nSo this is just strictly better for those cases you and a service provider have agreed to hand over some authenticating data about your identity.\n\nNow I see the concern that the ease of this technology will encourage more service providers to start asking for this info to verify you, but the fact remains not everyone carries a phone, so not every service provider is going to start requiring identity verification for you to enter the building or use their services. Those that wanted to know your identity can already ask for it—by asking to scan your driver\'s license or for you to upload a photo of it. If they haven\'t asked for it yet, it\'s because they aren\'t required to by law and they have determined the loss of customers who are annoyed by the ask wouldn\'t be worth what they gain in return. So it will be with digital IDs. Just because it\'s suddenly easier to digitally receive cryptographic claims about identity doesn\'t mean Reddit will suddenly start asking for your ID—because if they did, they would see a mass drop in usership.']"

A now-defunct channel allegedly run by Humber, for example, featured instructions on how to make a vast array of potent explosives. After their arrests, channels allegedly run by Humber and Allison went silent.\n\n&gt;But within days of the indictments, an anonymous Telegram user had set up a new channel “dedicated to updates about their situation.”\n\n&gt;“I understand that some people may not like these two, however, their arrests and possible prosecution affects all of us,” the user wrote. The criminal case, they argued, “shows us that Telegram is under attack globally.”\n\nThis is an long article. It also mentions 2 individuals arrested this summer. One was planning racist motivated attacks and posting his plans online. The was giving someone detailed instructions on how to bomb a power plant, including how to make the bomb. \n\nThese are the terrorist masterminds getting others to do the acts of violence.', '&gt; The two are alleged Accelerationists, a subset of white supremacists intent on accelerating the collapse of today’s liberal democracies and replacing them with all-white ethno-states, according to the indictment.\n\nThis is a common mistake that reporters seem to make.

1fp8tub,"In the room where it happened: When NASA nearly gave Boeing all the crew funding | ""In all my years of working with Boeing I never saw them sign up for additional work for free.""",,1727282042.0,technology,"['Some of the highlights below:\n\n&gt;That spring the companies were finalizing bids to develop a spacecraft and fly six operational missions to the space station. These contracts were worth billions of dollars. Each company told NASA how much it needed for the job, and if selected, would receive a fixed price award for that amount. Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada wanted as much money as they could get, of course. But each had an incentive to keep their bids low, as NASA had a finite budget for the program. Boeing had a solution, telling NASA it needed the entire Commercial Crew budget to succeed. Because a lot of decision-makers believed that only Boeing could safely fly astronauts, the company\'s gambit very nearly worked.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;The members of the evaluation board scored the companies based on three factors. Price was the most important consideration, given NASA\'s limited budget. This was followed by ""mission suitability,"" and finally, ""past performance."" These latter two factors, combined, were about equally weighted to price. SpaceX dominated Boeing on price.\n&gt;\n&gt;Boeing asked for $4.2 billion, 60 percent more than SpaceX\'s bid of $2.6 billion. The second category, mission suitability, assessed whether a company could meet NASA\'s requirements and actually safely fly crew to and from the station. For this category, Boeing received an ""excellent"" rating, above SpaceX\'s ""very good."" The third factor, past performance, evaluated a company\'s recent work. Boeing received a rating of ""very high,"" whereas SpaceX received a rating of ""high.""\n&gt;\n&gt;While this makes it appear as though the bids were relatively even, McAlister said the score differences in mission suitability and past performance were, in fact, modest. It was a bit like grades in school. SpaceX scored something like an 88, and got a B; whereas Boeing got a 91 and scored an A. Because of the significant difference in price, McAlister said, the source evaluation board assumed SpaceX would win the competition. He was thrilled, because he figured this meant that NASA would have to pick two companies, SpaceX based on price, and Boeing due to its slightly higher technical score. He wanted competition to spur both of the companies on.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Near the end of the discussion, Gerstenmaier solicited McAlister\'s opinion. In turn, McAlister started asking questions. First, he turned to Bill McNally, the agency\'s head of procurement. Prior to joining NASA, McNally had spent nearly three decades in acquisition for the US Air Force, managing the Tomahawk cruise missile program and leading technology contracts for the ""Star Wars"" missile defense program. McAlister asked if the veteran procurement official had ever seen a federal agency choose a bidder that cost 60 percent more when both bids were technically acceptable.\n&gt;\n&gt;McNally shifted uncomfortably in his seat at this question. Eventually he remarked that the source selection official, Gerstenmaier, could do whatever he pleased. McAlister pressed further, repeating the question. ""No,"" McNally replied. ""That would be uncharted territory.""\n&gt;\n&gt;Next, McAlister questioned the engineer representing safety and mission assurance, Deirdre Healey. When she had spoken, Healey said the safety division preferred Boeing as long as the company performed an in-flight test of its spacecraft\'s abort system—powerful thrusters that push the vehicle away in case the rocket malfunctions during launch. But Boeing did not plan to do so. Their bid included a ground test of this abort system, not one in flight. McAlister seized on this, asking Healey if this meant Boeing\'s proposal should really be considered unsatisfactory.\n&gt;\n&gt;No, Healey replied, indicating the bid was acceptable to her.\n&gt;\n&gt;Another member of the source evaluation board at the meeting, a deputy procurement manager from Johnson Space Center named Lee Pagel, said this question scored points for McAlister. It was strange that so many smart people thought NASA could just snap its fingers and Boeing would conduct an in-flight abort test. ""In all my years of working with Boeing I never saw them sign up for additional work for free,"" he said.\n&gt;\n&gt;After addressing his questions to McNally and Healey, McAlister turned to Gerstenmaier.\n&gt;\n&gt;""I told Gerst he had to pick two,"" McAlister said. ""His head of safety and mission assurance just said Boeing\'s proposal was unsatisfactory, and the head of procurement said the cost would be difficult to defend. And Elon sues everybody.""\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;At the same time, McAlister kept pushing Gerstenmaier, telling him competition was essential to moving the program forward as Boeing and SpaceX strove against one another to build the safest, most reliable, and most cost-effective system. Eventually, Gerstenmaier agreed. He called the NASA administrator, Charlie Bolden, to say he was going to blow a hole in the agency\'s budget. Instead of asking Congress for $870 million in the budget for Commercial Crew the next fiscal year, NASA would need $1.25 billion.\n\nIt was helpful to read about some of the behind-the-scenes discussions around these contracts, and how they proceeded. Given the struggles that Boeing is currently having, and with some hindsight, it was likely a good thing that they ended up going with two suppliers rather than just one.']"

There are several reasons why it will not be updated anymore.\n\n**Generative AI has polluted the data**\n\nI don\'t think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by humans.\n\nThe open Web (via OSCAR) was one of wordfreq\'s data sources. Now the Web at large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to communicate nothing. Including this slop in the data skews the word frequencies.\n\nSure, there was spam in the wordfreq data sources, but it was manageable and often identifiable. Large language models generate text that masquerades as real language with intention behind it, even though there is none, and their output crops up everywhere.\n\nAs one example, Philip Shapira reports that ChatGPT (OpenAI\'s popular brand of generative language model circa 2024) is obsessed with the word ""delve"" in a way that people never have been, and caused its overall frequency to increase by an order of magnitude.\n\n**Information that used to be free became expensive**\n\nwordfreq is not just concerned with formal printed words. It collected more conversational language usage from two sources in particular: Twitter and Reddit.\n\nThe Twitter data was always built on sand. Even when Twitter allowed free access to a portion of their ""firehose"", the terms of use did not allow me to distribute that data outside of the company where I collected it (Luminoso). wordfreq has the frequencies that were built with that data as input, but the collected data didn\'t belong to me and I don\'t have it anymore.\n\nNow Twitter is gone anyway, its public APIs have shut down, and the site has been replaced with an oligarch\'s plaything, a spam-infested right-wing cesspool called X. Even if X made its raw data feed available (which it doesn\'t), there would be no valuable information to be found there.\n\nReddit also stopped providing public data archives, and now they sell their archives at a price that only OpenAI will pay.\n\n**I don\'t want to be part of this scene anymore**\n\nwordfreq used to be at the intersection of my interests. I was doing corpus linguistics in a way that could also benefit natural language processing tools.\n\nThe field I know as ""natural language processing"" is hard to find these days. It\'s all being devoured by generative AI. Other techniques still exist but generative AI sucks up all the air in the room and gets all the money. It\'s rare to see NLP research that doesn\'t have a dependency on closed data controlled by OpenAI and Google, two companies that I already despise.\n\nwordfreq was built by collecting a whole lot of text in a lot of languages. That used to be a pretty reasonable thing to do, and not the kind of thing someone would be likely to object to. Now, the text-slurping tools are mostly used for training generative AI, and people are quite rightly on the defensive. If someone is collecting all the text from your books, articles, Web site, or public posts, it\'s very likely because they are creating a plagiarism machine that will claim your words as its own.\n\nSo I don\'t want to work on anything that could be confused with generative AI, or that could benefit generative AI.\n\nOpenAI and Google can collect their own damn data. I hope they have to pay a very high price for it, and I hope they\'re constantly cursing the mess that they made themselves.\n\n— Robyn Speer', 'This is the exactly kind of phenomenon that causes model collapse.', 'If what I’ve seen and read from experts is anything to go on, this is just the beginning of the downward spiral that could result from flooding the internet with content generated by AI that is trained with the aforementioned internet content.', 'It’s more likely that they encountered 7 million instances of “skibidi toilet” and then gave the fuck up.']"

He basically created silicon valley and, from what I've read, must have been a real character. And yet, he's almost forgotten (by most)."", '# A century ago, 391 San Antonio Road in Mountain View, California, was the site of an apricot-packing shed. Today it is just one of the many low-rise office blocks on busy roads that house Silicon Valley’s tech startups and wannabe billionaires. In front of it, though, stand three large and peculiar sculptures, two-legged and three-legged forms that bring to mind water towers. They are giant versions of two diodes and a transistor,\xa0components of electronic circuitry. In 1956, 391 San Antonio Road became the home to the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, a startup devoted to the idea of making such components entirely out of silicon. It is the birthplace of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe firm, founded by William Shockley, a coinventor of the transistor, was a commercial flop. The embrace of silicon was not. In 1957 eight of Mr Shockley’s employees, whom he dubbed the “traitorous eight”, defected to start Fairchild Semiconductor less than two kilometres away. Among them were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, future co-founders of Intel, a chipmaking giant, and Eugene Kleiner, co-founder of Kleiner Perkins, a ground-breaking venture-capital firm. Most of the storied tech companies in Silicon Valley can trace their roots, directly or indirectly, back to those early Fairchild employees.\n\nBefore semiconductor components were invented, computers were room-size machines that used fragile and finicky vacuum tubes. Semiconductors, solid materials in which the flow of electrical current can be controlled, offered components that were more sturdy, more versatile and smaller. And when such components were made mostly from silicon, it became possible to make a whole raft of them on a single piece of the stuff. Tiny transistors, diodes and the like on silicon “chips” could be wired together into “integrated circuits” designed to store or process data.\n\nIn 1965 Moore, while still at Fairchild, noted that the number of transistors that could be put into an integrated circuit at a given cost doubled every year (he later relaxed the doubling time to every two years). His observation, codified as “Moore’s law”, mattered. Chips produced in 1971 had 200 transistors per square millimetre. In 2023 the\xa0mi300, a processor built by\xa0amd, an American semiconductor firm, crammed 150m transistors into the same area. The smaller the transistors got, the faster they could switch on and off. The\xa0mi300’s components are thousands of times faster than their predecessors were 50 years ago.\n\nAll major breakthroughs in computing, from personal computers and the internet to smartphones and artificial intelligence (ai), can be traced to transistors getting smaller, faster and more affordable. The transistor’s progress has driven technology’s progress.\n\nFor a while, the technological centrality of silicon chips was mirrored by the importance of the businesses that made them. In the 1970s\xa0IBM, which made chips, the computers that used them and the software that ran on them, was a giant beyond compare. In the 1980s Microsoft proved that a company selling only software could be even more attractive. But Intel, which made the chips on which Microsoft’s software ran, was a huge force in its own right. Before the dotcom bust of 2000 Intel was the sixth-biggest company in the world by market capitalisation.\n\nAfter the bust, though, the “Web 2.0” services offered by firms like Google and Meta took centre stage, with the semiconductors on which their platforms were built increasingly commodified. To describe the dynamic underlying the growth of big tech, it was software, not silicon, that Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist, credited in 2011 with “eating the world”.']"

1fcbpek,Sweden says kids under 2 should have zero screen time ,,1725838918.0,technology,"[""This isn't Sweden banning screen time for kids, it's the result of a large study and subsequent **recommendations** based on the findings. They even state in their report that it is indeed very hard to impose a zero-screen time rule even for younger kids. Nonetheless, the researchers were tasked with finding a recommended amount of screen time based on health and development factors and they found that for children under 2 that recommended amount is zero.\n\nWhat they found was simply that there are no benefits to letting children under the age of 2 use screens at all. There are several (albeit maybe not huge) negative effects of using screens. Therefore the recommendation is that kids under 2 should not use screens at all. It's nothing more than that, really. I think almost everyone agrees with that, if you ignore everything else and only look at it from that perspective (which they were told to do).\n\nAgain, noone is honestly expecting parents to ban screens in their homes completely. I would say this is pretty much the same thing as a general recommendations that you should not eat candy, since there are no health benefits gained from it. Too much sugar, minimal nutritional value, etc. People will still eat candy, of course, but at least everyone can agree that it's *not really* good for you - and you shouldn't let kids eat it whenever they want since they can't reason like adults.\n\nEdit: I think a more interesting discussion would be about how screen time affects older children, between 10-15 for example. In these cases it's more of a balancing act between the positives (online learning, language acquisition, being available and connected with friends and the positive benefits of that) and negatives (body image issues, depression, decreased quantity/quality of sleep, etc.)."", ""I believe children under 10 shouldn't be given phones and only then under careful supervision. \n\nTechnology is a wonderful thing, and it makes life so much easier.

Even then, office occupancy was usually 70%.”*\n\n*“I expect a loosening of the policy as this public display of ‘office nostalgia’ versus the expected reality of offices—that they will still be half-empty even after the mandate goes into effect—will be visible to everyone.”*', 'Of course he\'ll backtrack.\n\n1.

Harris was California\'s attorney general at the time, and has been a longtime Bay Area resident.\n\nAnalysis of the article and site indicate the story is false; public records and news reports show no evidence of the hit-and-run incident. The San Francisco Police Department told CBS News that they could not find records of the incident. A CBS News analysis of a video that accompanied the article found it contained several photos from other unrelated news stories\n\nDespite this, the story spread widely on social media before the site disappeared. Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, that featured the article and video amassed more than 7 million views, and the story was also shared on Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. Pro-Russian channels on Telegram, the popular messaging app European officials are investigating for alleged criminal activity on the platform, also shared the story and video.\n\n  \nThe KBSF-TV site, designed with the appearance of a local news outlet, was created as a WordPress blog on Aug. 20, and went offline two days after it published the story. CBS News could not find official records for a KBSF-TV in California, indicating that it is a bogus site. \n\nThe woman featured in the five-minute video embedded within the article speaks about the alleged incident. Her name is listed as ""Alicia Brown"" in the video, but her name appears as ""Alisha Brown"" in the article. An online search did not find an individual matching the woman\'s location, age, physical description and name — including the spelling variation — to contact for comment.\n\nCBS News identified several elements in the video that indicate the story is fabricated. A chest X-ray shown in the video appears to have been taken from a medical journal and the date printed on the image shows it was taken in 2004, several years before the alleged incident. An image of a car crash shown in the video was from a 2018 incident in Guam.']"

Fees decreased slightly for Pro and Enterprise customers after $1 million in revenue and 1 million installs.\n&gt;\n&gt;The move led to almost immediate backlash from many developers. Unity, whose then-CEO John Riccitiello had described in 2015 as having ""no royalties, no [f-ing] around,"" was ""quite simply not a company to be trusted,"" wrote Necrosoft Games\' Brandon Sheffield. Developers said they would hold off updates or switch engines rather than absorb the fee, which would have retroactively counted installs before January 2024 toward its calculations.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Unity\'s terms of service seemed to allow for such sudden shifts. Unity softened the impact of the fee on Personal users, removed the backdated install counting, and capped fees at 2.5 percent of revenue. Unity Create President and General Manager Marc Whitten told Ars at that time that while the fee would seemingly not affect the vast majority of Unity users, he understood that a stable agreement should be a feature of the engine.\n&gt;\n&gt;However coincidentally or not, Riccitiello announced his retirement the next month, which led to some celebration among devs, but not total restoration of trust. A massive wave of layoffs throughout the winter of 2023 and 2024 showed that Unity\'s financial position was precarious, partly due to acquisitions during Riccitiello\'s term.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;""From this point forward, it’s our intention to revert to a more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis,"" Bromberg wrote in his post. Changes to Unity\'s Editor software should allow customers to keep using their existing version under previously agreed terms, he wrote.\n\nThis looks to be good news for developers, but it\'s disappointing that it had to get to this point for the company to reconsider their decisions that got them there. The last thing anyone wants are more unknowns when it comes to pricing.', 'The absolutely dumb decisions of Unity should be taught in schools.\n\nHere\'s what I\'ve seen on only a few years:\n\n1.

CEO John Riccitiello comments demeaning developers who don\'t prioritize monetization, furthering the perception of profit over community.\n\n3.  Unity\'s merger with ironSource, a company associated with adware, shifted focus towards monetization, worrying developers about the platform\'s direction.\n\n4. Multiple rounds of layoffs created concerns over internal instability, particularly with key talent leaving the company and reducing product quality.\n\n5.  Unity\'s growing focus on industries outside gaming has had low ROI , neglecting it\'s core game developer community \n\n6. Developers have increasingly experienced service disruptions and technical issues, undermining confidence in Unity\'s reliability.\n\n7.  Unity’s aggressive push for in-app purchases, ads, and analytics solutions has alienated many developers by prioritizing profits over user experience.\n\n8.  Unity has diluted shareholder value by issuing stock to fund acquisitions like ironSource, which have poor odds of significant returns on investment.\n\nSuch a shit show when people running it think you get infinite good will because it\'s a ubiquitous tool.']"

1fdwm68,"SpaceX says regulators will keep Starship grounded until at least November | SpaceX blames the regulatory delay on ""issues ranging from the frivolous to the patently absurd.""",,1726012456.0,technology,"['Some excerpts from the article:\n\n&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration has signaled to SpaceX that it won\'t approve a launch license for the next test flight of the Starship rocket until at least late November, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is more than two months later than the mid-September timeframe the FAA previously targeted for determining whether to approve a launch license for the next Starship flight. SpaceX says the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage for the next launch—the fifth full-scale test flight of the Starship program—have been ready to launch since the first week of August.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""The flight test will include our most ambitious objective yet: attempt to return the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catch it in mid-air,"" SpaceX said in a statement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Environmental regulations and mitigations serve a noble purpose, stemming from common-sense safeguards to enable progress while preventing undue impact to the environment,"" SpaceX said. ""However, with the licensing process being drawn out for Flight 5, we find ourselves delayed for unreasonable and exasperating reasons.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""This delay was not based on a new safety concern, but instead driven by superfluous environmental analysis,"" SpaceX said. ""The four open environmental issues are illustrative of the difficulties launch companies face in the current regulatory environment for launch and reentry licensing.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One of the environmental issues involves SpaceX\'s discharge of water into the environment around the Starship launch pad in Texas. The pad uses water to cool a steel flame deflector that sits under the 33 main engines of Starship\'s Super Heavy booster. SpaceX says fines levied against it this year by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency were ""entirely tied to disagreements over paperwork"" and not any dumping of pollutants in water from the launch pad into the environment around the Starship launch site.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the next flight, the Super Heavy booster will follow a different trajectory than it flew on the previous Starship mission in June. This means a stainless steel ring that jettisons from the top of the booster, called the hot-staging ring, will fall in a different location in the Gulf of Mexico just offshore from the rocket\'s launch and landing site. This change, which SpaceX calls ""marginal,"" prompted the FAA to approve a 60-day consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service to reassess the impact of the hot-staging ring on marine wildlife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The trajectory of the Super Heavy booster returning to land back onshore in Texas, rather than off the coast in the Gulf of Mexico as it did in June, will expose a larger area to a sonic boom. This prompted the FAA to approve another 60-day consultation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to look at the sonic boom\'s effect on animals.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""This will be a singularly novel operation in the history of rocketry,"" SpaceX wrote of the upcoming recovery attempt for the Super Heavy booster. ""SpaceX engineers have spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The role of the FAA in regulating commercial space launches and reentry operations is to ensure an errant rocket or spacecraft doesn\'t threaten public safety. The agency also requires launch companies to maintain insurance to protect against third-party claims for damages. SpaceX said it ""accepts no compromises when it comes to ensuring public safety.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The FAA is also charged with ensuring commercial launch and reentry operations adhere with the US government\'s national security and foreign policy interests.\n\nEnvironmental and other safety concerns are not insignificant issues here. That this is a \'singularly novel operation in the history of rocketry\' should indicate that there would be additional scrutiny on what is being proposed and what some of the outcomes might be. It would be irresponsible for a regulator to let things proceed without first determining to their best abilities that what is being proposed is safe.']"

I hope he finally gets served some justice one day.', 'Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to pay a daily fine of R$5 million ($900,000 USD) on Thursday following the platform’s failure to comply with the court’s order to suspend its operation in Brazil.\n\nThe decision comes after Brazil’s National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) reported an update to X’s application that provided users access to the platform, breaching the court’s previous order. The court stressed that X’s disregard of its decision disrespected Brazil’s judiciary and ordered ANATEL to adopt the necessary measures to maintain the suspension of the platform’s operation in the country. The court further ordered that the agency suspend CDN Cloudflare, Fastly, EdgeUno and other servers created to evade the suspension.\n\nThe Supreme Court initially ordered the suspension of X in August as the platform failed to comply with Brazil’s legal requirement to appoint a local representative. The court upheld its decision in early September and imposed a daily fine of R$50,000 (approximately $8,900 USD) on individuals and entities attempting to bypass the suspension using technological means such as virtual private networks (VPNs). The decision prompted former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to lead a free speech rally on Brazil’s Independence Day amid growing dissent over the suspension.\n\nJustice Alexandre de Moraes halted the suspension following the transfer of R$18,350,000 to the national treasury from funds previously frozen in the bank accounts of X on September 13.\n\nThe case surrounding X’s activities in Brazil escalated in April when the court ordered the removal of certain users from X without justification, with the company claiming the decision violated the Marco Civil da Internet and the Brazilian Constitution. However, defying the decision to block access to the undisclosed accounts, X CEO Elon Musk was subjected to a criminal inquiry by Justice Moraes. X then announced the closure of its operations in Brazil following what it referred to as “censorship orders” by Justice Moraes.\n\nThe cause of Moraes’s war against X and its CEO is rooted in the disinformation inquiry and an STF investigation into whether former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro attempted to incite a coup d’état following his loss in the country’s 2022 presidential elections, as Moraes claimed that anti-democratic actors used social media platforms and private messaging services to undermine Brazil’s democracy.', 'Good.

It primarily teaches students pursuing master’s degrees in engineering and other programs, and summer study-abroad students. The students come from all over the world. Georgia Tech had hoped to one day have as many as 3,000 students there. But in 2020 Tianjin University was put on a U.S. government blacklist — the Commerce Department’s Entity List — for allegedly stealing American technology with military applications, according to lawmakers.\n\nAt that point, Georgia Tech began assessing its partnerships in China, canceled plans to add Ph.D programs and capped the number of students at 10 percent of its original goal. But Tianjin University remains on the Entity List, making the partnership infeasible, school officials said.\n\nA spokesperson for Tianjin University could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\n\nPending federal legislation would bar U.S. universities that collaborate with institutions on the Entity List from receiving any Defense Department funding, McLaughlin said.\n\nThe Georgia Tech Research Institute receives hundreds of millions of dollars a year from the federal government, McLaughlin said. “We’re a huge recipient of DOD funding, and national security is a huge priority for us,” he said.\n\nIn May, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) announced that the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce were launching an investigation into Georgia Tech and its relationship with Tianjin University.\n\nThe committee said that the partnership was particularly troubling since the Georgia Tech Research Institute works with the Department of Defense to solve national security problems.\n\nLawmakers asked school leaders for information about Georgia Tech’s relationship with the Chinese university, including its funding, in a letter to Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera. They contended that Tianjin University is deeply embedded in a Chinese military-civil fusion “under which purportedly civilian companies, universities, and technologies are leveraged for military ends.”\n\nGeorgia Tech and Tianjin University had almost no collaboration, according to Georgia Tech officials, “and certainly no institutional research collaboration.” They weren’t doing research at the site and didn’t use U.S. federal funds there, McLaughlin said.\n\nMcLaughlin said university officials had answered all of the lawmakers’ questions. “We’re in the business of educating our students,” he said, and that’s what was happening at the Shenzhen site.\n\n“Supporting the Chinese government in any way, shape or form?” he said. “… Absolutely, emphatically, no.”\n\nThe decision to exit the partnership wasn’t easy, he said. “It’s a front-row seat to one of the most exciting places in the world, that we think our students should see and experience and understand in light of the world that they’re going to live in. It’s so incredibly important to our students to have those kinds of experiences.”\n\nSixty percent of Georgia Tech students have some kind of study-abroad experience, he said. “That’s the heart and soul of why we were there.”\n\nBut, he said, like other universities, they are reassessing their relationship with China.\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), the chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said Friday that she hopes other universities follow Georgia Tech’s lead.\n\n“The captain of the Titanic didn’t get a gold star for passing out life vests, and it shouldn’t have taken a congressional investigation to spur Georgia Tech to end its partnership with a blacklisted Chinese entity,” she said in a written statement. “Nonetheless, we’re glad that Georgia Tech has made the right call.”\n\nStudents who were studying at the site in Shenzhen will be able to complete their degrees — perhaps at Georgia Tech’s campus in Atlanta or another site, school officials said. And the university will continue to offer global experiences to students, including in Shenzhen, they announced Friday.\n\n“Connecting globally remains one of our core values,” McLaughlin said.', 'Sounds like the university (Georgia Institute of Tech) has serious problems going on.\xa0https://cyberscoop.com/georgia-tech-lawsuit-dod-contracts-cybersecurity/']"

It reduces the energy consumption of the heat pump by about 20%... but would just putting ""a few more panels"" on the roof to produce that energy instead be more or less expensive than this system?

This would reduce the market available or be prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe main thing we were focusing on was looking at drawing heat from the solar panels and using that to heat water. This would result in (1) prolonged life of the PV panel, biggest degradation factor is operating temperature (2) 'free' hot water, solar thermal systems are pretty efficient and tying this into a heat storage system would result in additional energy harvested.""]"

1fdkx4z,Rystad: Germany Set to Generate 80% of Its Electricity With Renewables by 2030 ,,1725982771.0,technology,"['Germany’s power market is in the midst of a significant transition. Demand continues to fall despite normalizing prices, and retired coal and nuclear capacity mean the European giant is now heavily reliant on imports from its neighbors. But it’s not all bad news for the sector. Rystad Energy projections show Germany will surpass its policy goal of 80% renewable energy generation by 2030, largely thanks to the rapid capacity build-up of solar and wind. While the country’s quick adoption of renewable energy systems has helped to offset the loss of traditional power capacity to a degree, the speed of the transition has not been sufficient to keep up with demand.\n\nRenewable energy capacity in Germany has grown significantly in recent years. With 143 gigawatts of alternating current (GWac) installed by the end of 2023, the nation is the stand-out leader in Europe. New solar and wind installations hit a record last year, but that record is set to be broken again in 2024. Renewable energy auctions have been the primary driver of utility-scale additions, and much more capacity is planned to be auctioned in the coming years.', ""Europe basically saved the U.S. from itself with this move.\n\nIf all of Europe goes electric, we're going to be required to produce green tech to stay competitive.

With the rise of the Internet and social media, misinformation researchers, especially, have become targets for online partisan attacks (see Nature 630, 548–550; 2024). And academics routinely have to ward off political interference in many countries1.\n\nRenée DiResta knows this only too well. A former research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) in California, she has been on the receiving end of online attacks for years, owing to her academic work combating misinformation about elections and vaccine efficacy. After a barrage of unsubstantiated accusations — including those levelled in a controversial investigation by the US House of Representatives’ judiciary committee, chaired by Republican congressman Jim Jordan — DiResta found that her research group at the SIO was suddenly dismantled in June, reportedly because of a change in institutional priorities.\n\nIn Invisible Rulers, DiResta documents her stormy personal and professional journey into what she describes as the “fantasy–industrial complex”. It’s an insightful account of how, over the past two decades, social-media influencers, algorithms and crowds have hijacked the public debate on consequential topics — from vaccination campaigns to the validity of elections. The book’s central thesis is this: a few social-media propagandists increasingly have the power to profoundly shape public opinion. And the only maxim that seems to guide their action is, as DiResta puts it: “if you make it trend, you make it true”.\n\nThe book’s title is a reference to public-relations pioneer Edward Bernay’s 1928 work Propaganda, which describes the ‘invisible’ people who fashion public sentiment — including public-relations experts and advertising executives. Today, that power can be in anyone’s hands.\n\nCharismatic individuals with large online followings are the new invisible rulers. The most elite among them, DiResta writes, possess the storytelling skills of a leading marketing executive, have the audience size of a television anchor and yet create the cozy, intimate feeling of a phone call with your best friend. They can also make immense profits, she notes, by pretending to be an ordinary person who is helping their audience to “break free of the lying mainstream media”.\n\n  \nDiResta’s own journey into the world of misinformation began as a concerned mother trying to work out why classroom vaccination rates were declining in California amid a measles outbreak in 2014. She documents how, after joining the vaccine debate in support of a state bill that sought to remove ‘personal belief’ as a valid ground for seeking exemption from mandatory vaccination programmes, she was deluged by online attacks from bots and trolls.', ""Social media has turned the public discourse into different kinds of religious extremism, even when religion is not involved at all.\n\nIt's all the same kind identity politics and cultist mentality, right or left wing it does not matter.""]"

But it is somewhat undone by a few things. First is that RTOS unfortunately has several meanings. By far the most common RTOSes do not have any kind of timeline guarantees. They are more predictable in terms of interrupt handling latencies and scheduling. But they do not make timeline guarantees. RTOSes that make these guarantees are a subset and call what they offer ""deadline scheduling"" and are sometimes called ""hard realtime RTOSes"".\n\nSecond is how they describe ""NO_HZ"". First thing to say is more often this would be called ""tickless"". Tickless is a lot more common now than it used to be in OSes. This however is not due to 1,000 processor machines (although it is likely useful in those) but because of the many levels of sleep/power saving states in high performance processors now and the importance of using those power saving states. Power management used to mean ""run as fast as you can and halt as soon as possible"". Now it includes many other things like managing voltage levels, migrating to smaller cores, etc. A lot of this is less effective or even undone if the processor is being interrupted 100 times a second on a tick.\n\nAdditionally, there\'s no way that realtime linux introduced mutexes to linux. There literally is no such thing as an OS without mutexes. As the paper which they link to says. As soon as you have concurrent scheduling you have race conditions and you need mutexes to solve those race conditions.\n\nI would imagine what realtime linux really did is add some new form of mutexes. A smarter, better one. Because for sure linux had them before. Specifically linux has used futexes for decades now.\n\nI appreciate zdnet actually getting deep into tech instead of just doing product recommendations though. Keep up with the explainers.\n\nAnyway, as others said, if linux really can fulfill the realtime needs of hard realtime (or even near hard realtime) processes then it\'s probably going to take an even larger part of the OS market than it has today.', 'Cool stuff, I never knew this was being worked on to integrate into the main kernel.

1fcrqzf,Google’s Next Antitrust Trial Could Make Online Ads Less Annoying | Google will be in court on Monday to face allegations of an ad tech monopoly. Experts say that a DOJ win could create a better browsing future,,1725894583.0,technology,"['Some sections from this article:\n\n&gt;The government contends that controlling DoubleClick enabled Google to corner websites into doing business with its other services. That has resulted in Google allegedly monopolizing three big links of a vital digital advertising supply chain, which funnels over $12 billion in annual revenue to websites and apps in the US alone.\n&gt;\n&gt;It’s a big amount. But a government expert estimates in court filings that if Google were not allegedly destroying its competition illegally, those publishers would be receiving up to an additional hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Starved of that potential funding, “publishers are pushed to put more ads on their websites, to put more content behind costly paywalls, or to cease business altogether,” the government alleges. It all adds up to a subpar experience on the web for consumers, Colorado attorney general Phil Weiser says.\n&gt;\n&gt;“Google is able to extract hiked-up costs, and those are passed on to consumers,” he alleges. “The overall outcome we want is for consumers to have more access to content supported by advertising revenue and for people who are seeking advertising not to have to pay inflated costs.”\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;The Justice Department alleges that acquiring DoubleClick gave Google “a pool of captive publishers that now had fewer alternatives and faced substantial switching costs associated with changing to another publisher ad server.” The global market share of Google’s tool for publishers is now 91 percent, according to court papers. The company holds similar control over ad exchanges that broker deals (around 70 percent) and tools used by advertisers (85 percent), the court filings say.\n&gt;\n&gt;Google’s dominance, the government argues, has “impaired the ability of publishers and advertisers to choose the ad tech tools they would prefer to use and diminished the number and quality of viable options available to them.”\n&gt;\n&gt;The government alleges that Google staff spoke internally about how they have been earning an unfair portion of what advertisers spend on advertising, to the tune of over a third of every $1 spent in some cases.\n&gt;\n&gt;Some of Google’s competitors want the tech giant to be broken up into multiple independent companies, so each of its advertising services competes on its own merits without the benefit of one pumping up another. The rivals also support rules that would bar Google from preferencing its own services. “What all in the industry are looking for is fair competition,” Viant’s Vanderhook says.\n\nOn one hand, determining whether Google has monopolized the online ad space could result in some consequences for both the company and the online ad ecosystem. On the other hand, past experience indicates that the likelihood of this being the impetus for an improved browsing experience for the general public is relatively small absent other external controls being imposed.']"

Several proposals focused on hospitals, including a carrot-and-stick program to reward providers that adopted certain “essential” security practices and penalize those that didn’t.\n&gt;\n&gt;Even that narrow focus could take years to materialize: Under the department’s budget proposal, money would start flowing to “high-needs” hospitals in fiscal year 2027.\n&gt;\n&gt;The focus on hospitals is “not appropriate,” Iliana Peters, a former enforcement lawyer at HHS’ Office for Civil Rights, said in an interview. “The federal government needs to go further” by also investing in the organizations that supply and contract with providers, she said.\n&gt;\n&gt;The department’s interest in protecting patient health and safety “does put hospitals near the top of our priority partners list,” Brian Mazanec, a deputy director at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at HHS, said in an interview.\n&gt;\n&gt;Responsibility for the nation’s health cybersecurity is shared by three offices within two different agencies. The health department’s civil rights office is a sort of cop on the beat, monitoring whether hospitals and other health groups have adequate defenses for patient privacy and, if not, potentially fining them.\n&gt;\n&gt;The health department’s preparedness office and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency help build defenses — such as mandating that medical software developers use auditing technology to check their security.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Much of the HHS strategy is due to be rolled out over the coming months. The department has already requested more funding. The preparedness office, for example, wants an additional $12 million for cybersecurity. The civil rights office, with a flat budget and declining enforcement staff, is due to release an update to its privacy and security rules.\n&gt;\n&gt;“There's still significant challenges that the industry as a whole faces,” Routh said. “I don't see anything on the horizon that's necessarily going to change that.”\n\nIt's pretty disappointing to see a continued lack of resources and/or willingness to improve online security, especially in critical infrastructure such as healthcare. By this point, it's not that we don't know how we can keep our systems more secure, but rather that there's an unwillingness to implement the policies and systems that will improve security.

1fhv0jc,"The Auto Industry Finally Has a Plan to Stop Electric Vehicle Fires | EVs can burn for days, firefighters have little or no training to deal with them, and conventional equipment isn’t effective. But new technology is being developed that should make all the difference",,1726456907.0,technology,"[""Some of the various strategies currently under consideration or being used:\n\n&gt;Some battery makers have taken steps to reduce the risk of their batteries catching fire. The first is to create stringent manufacturing processes and standards. This is important because any sort of flaw in a battery could lead to an inferno, says Venkat Srinivasan, who studies batteries and directs the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science at the US’s Argonne National Laboratory.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Since the first Tesla hit the road in 2008, the standard electric vehicle battery has been made primarily from nickel and cobalt. Batteries with this makeup charge quickly and hold lots of energy, which is great for EV use because drivers of vehicles that use them enjoy longer ranges and faster top-ups. They’re also more likely to enter “thermal runaway” at lower temperatures, in the 400- to 300-degrees Fahrenheit (210 to 150 degrees Celsius) range.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Enter lithium-iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries. LFP batteries enter thermal runaway at higher temperatures, around 520 degrees Fahrenheit (270 degrees Celsius), because the bonds between iron and phosphate are stronger than the bonds between cobalt and oxygen. They’re also slower to degrade than other chemistries. And, finally, the powerful advantage from automakers’ point of view: They’re cheaper to make.\n&gt;\n&gt;Many automakers have shifted towards LFP batteries. Tesla Models 3 and Y purchased in the US after 2022 have them, and so do Rivians and Fords. Now Stellantis and Mercedes Benz are reportedly pivoting to LFP production too. The attraction of LFP batteries has also grown as automakers (including Tesla) have turned to cell-to-chassis manufacturing, which integrates the battery into the structure of the car. Automakers using this newer technique mostly use LFP batteries. “For the concept to be safe, the chemistry needs to be safe,” says Srinivasan, the researcher.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;The true technological hero of less fire-y batteries is just over the horizon: solid state. “Solid state” refers to a few sorts of battery technologies, but the ones with the lowest fire risk use a solid electrolyte, rather than a liquid one, to separate the anode and cathode, which isn’t flammable. “That removes a big problem,” says Srinivasan.\n&gt;\n&gt;For years, automakers and battery developers have hyped the prospect of solid-state batteries, but they have yet to show up in production cars. The good news is that solid-state batteries are performing better than ever, says Srinivasan. “It’s night and day in terms of what’s happened in the last five years.” The bad news is that the great performances are happening in the lab. Like most new technologies, solid-state batteries face a standard list of hurdles: building supply chains to support their manufacture; perfecting the processes for mass production; and competing against lithium-ion tech. Getting there could take years.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Products to tamp down already ablaze batteries abound. Fire blankets are meant to reduce the smoke damage of serious fires, including those set off by Li-ion batteries. Some sellers offer extinguishers specially made to put out electric vehicle battery fires. The Nevada-based company E-FireX uses an agent called “TRPL-E” that the firm says is designed to be kept in places like garages and truck beds and to tamp down on thermal runaway until fire professionals can intervene.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Firefighters could also use some help from manufacturers to prevent out-of-control blazes, says Emma Sutcliffe, the project director of EV Fire Safe, a private firm founded by the Australian government to research EV fire risks. Some auto- and battery-makers are great at sharing free and easy-to-access “emergency response guides,” which take fire professionals through what they need to know to stop their products’ battery fires. Sutcliffe highlights Tesla as a company that is proactive about sharing with fire departments.\n&gt;\n&gt;Other manufacturers have been savvy at making it easy for firefighters to get at fires once they’ve started. Renault builds a “fireman access” port into its EVs and hybrids, which allows first responders to pump water directly into an on-fire battery. (Sutcliffe notes that, while handy, the port is only useful in the early stages of a fire, before it has expanded beyond the pack.)\n\nIt's good to see that there's continued innovation on how to manage fires and other challenges with battery packs, especially as they become ubiquitous items in our daily lives. The EU's upcoming requirements for a 'battery passport' can also be useful in helping both consumers as well as technicians understand the history of each battery and therefore understand how to best manage their particular risks."", 'I thought throwing a giant fire blanket over them was already a thing.', ""I've seen a few videos where they just pull a large fire blanket over the car to smother it.""]"

And they always looked fabulous on her.”\n\nIn 2022, two weeks after she turned 17, Coco left home just outside New York City to meet with a dealer she’d messaged through Instagram who promised to sell her Percocet. She never made it home. She was found dead the next day, two blocks from the address that the guy had provided her.\n\nWhatever the dealer gave Coco, her mother said, was not Percocet. It was a fake pill laced with fentanyl, which can be lethal in a dose as small as the tip of a pencil.\n\nFentanyl overdoses have become a leading cause of death for minors in the last five years or so, even as overall drug use has dropped slightly. In a 2022 analysis of fentanyl-laced prescription pills, the DEA found that six out of 10 contained a potentially lethal dose of the drug.\n\nAnd social media, where tainted, fake prescription drugs can be obtained with just a few clicks, is a big part of the problem. Experts, law enforcement and children’s advocates say companies like Snap, TikTok, Telegram and Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram, are not doing enough to keep children safe.']"

He expressed passionately the ambitions of Tesla and Solarcity—which later got incorporated into Tesla Energy—and how they would combat global warming.*\n\n*The manifesto existed for nearly two decades, but now Tesla has quietly taken it down from its website, Forbes first reported.*\n\n*Titled “The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me),” it laid out a vision for zero emissions road transport, written by the CEO himself.*\n\n*“The overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine and burn, hydrocarbon economy towards a solar-electric economy, which I believe to be the primary but not exclusive sustainable solution,” he wrote.*\n\n*[...] Since then, Tesla has spearheaded the EV revolution, forcing legacy automakers into a frantic race to catch up.*\n\n*While competitors scrambled to develop their own EVs, Tesla not only built America’s most extensive and reliable charging network—now being opened to non-Tesla EVs—but also expanded its solar energy and Powerwall businesses.*\n\n*In many ways, Tesla delivered on its initial vision, including the bumpy but ultimately successful rollout of the mass-market Model 3 and then the Model Y which was 2023’s best-selling car.*\n\n*But now rivals are quickly catching up and Tesla's EV market share is sliding.*\n\n*[...] “My views on climate change and oil gas [...] are pretty moderate,” Musk said during a two-hour long interview with Trump early this month. “I don’t think we should vilify the oil and gas industry and the people that have worked very hard in those industries to provide the necessary energy to support the economy,” he added.*\n\n*[...] Now the oldest blog on Tesla’s website dates back to 2019. Everything before that is gone, as if it never existed. But thanks to published reports and archived fan pages, you can still access much of it.*""]"

Spoofing your UA to e.g. Safari *should* currently resolve the issue.\n- The initial implementation was affecting logged in users that aren\'t using adblockers to begin with, due to (multiple) internal errors on Googles end. This *should* be resolved over time.\n- The final implementation of this aims at delaying video playback for users who block ads, on all platforms/browsers.\n- Google is still actively working on this and already made changes to this *after* the initial wave of Reddit posts and news articles; A lot of infos out there might be outdated/incorrect.\n\n## Update\n\nThere\'s now a [follow-up article](https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-blames-ad-blockers-slow-load-times-3387523/) on the topic. TL;DR:\n\n&gt; YouTube has clarified and confirmed that users who continue using ad blockers may experience “suboptimal viewing,” regardless of their browser.\n\n#\n\n&gt; This statement comes as a response to user reports that allege that YouTube is intentionally adding a delay on non-Chrome browsers, as the delay allegedly goes away when using Chrome.\n\nGoogle\'s statement:\n\n&gt; To support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube, we’ve launched an effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium for an ad free experience.

But the issue raises concerns about why there isn’t an easy way to open the car from the outside when its 12-volt battery — the one that powers things like its door locks and windows — loses power.\n&gt;\n&gt;The car’s owner, Renee Sanchez, was taking her granddaughter to the zoo, but after loading the child in the Model Y, she closed the door and wasn’t able to open it again. “My phone key wouldn’t open it,” Sanchez said in an interview with Arizona’s Family. “My car key wouldn’t open it.” She called emergency services, and firefighters were dispatched to help.\n&gt;\n&gt;It is possible to open doors in a Model Y if you’re inside the vehicle when it has no power; there’s a latch to open a front door and a cable to open a back door. But that wasn’t an option for the young child, who was buckled into their car seat while Sanchez was stuck outside the car. You can jump-start a dead Tesla to be able to get into it, but it can be a complex process.\n\nI'm glad that the person had the presence of mind to call emergency services, and that there ultimately was a solution to get the toddler out of the vehicle in the Arizona sun.

It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would,” Dudesy said at the beginning of the special. “I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today.

There were issues with that format, but they were largely issues that existed within those same physical spaces and now had the option to move online. Bullying, arguments, gatekeeping, finding someone annoying, FOMO, comparison leading to bad self esteem. All of those existed IRL. You could argue that it’s worse that those things are made worse by being online 24/7 and I agree, but the fact is, you were going to feel excluded and inadequate for not being invited to the party whether you saw the photos from the party in real time on Friday night or found out about it Monday morning when everyone shared Polaroids from it. \n\nNow, social media is explicitly about consuming content. “Content” has always existed on the internet, but it was on other sites that were specifically about making content. You didn’t go on Facebook to see strangers’ content presented to you at random, you went on Facebook to see what your friends were up to. If you wanted to watch a funny video, you opened a separate window and went to YouTube or College Humor or one of the thousands of now obsolete websites where the purpose was to create funny videos. Now those two things are combined, and Facebook makes more money by showing you content. You’ll see entertainment from popular strangers before you see the photo of your sister’s baby. \n\nNow, you’re no longer comparing yourself to the popular people in your own community who all had a party without inviting you. You’re comparing yourself to total strangers whose lives you have no real concept of. You know, even if you feel inadequate in comparison, that the popular people in your town are just regular nobodies who make regular money, are barely attractive, live in their parents’ basements, and sit around in someone’s backyard drinking and talking about how cool they were in high school every weekend.

You know that her FaceTuned selfies don’t reflect reality and that she’s 30 pounds heavier and has acne in real life. And Keightlynn isn’t trying to sell you anything (probably). When a stranger who “creates content” shows you their expensive things, their glamorous lives, their perfect bodies, you have no frame of reference to remind yourself that they probably aren’t posting a realistic view of their lives, and there’s a good chance they’re stealthily advertising something.

They asked not to be identified discussing private matters.\n\nCurrently, Amazon has an office vacancy rate of 33.8%, this person said. That number is expected to drop to 25% in 2024 and go down to 10% over the next three to five years. The change will result in approximately $1.3 billion in annual operating expense savings, according to the internal document.\nThe company\'s office vacancy rate of almost 34% is the result of slower growth and layoffs, the person familiar told BI.\n\nGetting this down to about 10% in coming years will be another blow to the commercial real estate (https://www.businessinsider.com/commercial-real-estate-big-trouble-crash-bank-crisis-2024-2) market, which is already reeling from the remote work boom, overbuilding, and retrenchment by big companies such as Google and Meta.\n\nRating agency Fitch recently warned that the plunge in US office values (https://www.businessinsider.com/office-commercial-real-estate-cre-crash-2008-gfc-delinquency-vacancy-2024-3) could match or exceed 2008\'s real estate collapse, as prices have yet to bottom out.\nAmazon\'s office retrenchment is part of a broader, on-going cost-cutting strategy, which includes shuttered projects (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs-10000-employees-grand-challenge-team-dramatic-changes-2022-11), scaled back expansion plans (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-sublet-up-to-30-million-square-feet-warehouse-space-2022-5), and the largest layoffs in company history (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs).\n\nIn an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said it\'s normal business practice to review the company\'s real estate portfolio.\n\n""We\'re constantly evaluating our real estate portfolio based on the dynamic and diverse needs of Amazon\'s businesses by looking at trends in how employees are using our offices,"" Glasser said in a statement. ""The changes we\'ve already made are improving vacancy rates, and we expect to see further progress as we continue to learn and iterate on our portfolio.""\n\nHubs and hibernations\nAmazon is also trying to increase office density by mandating that employees relocate to central ""hubs,"" as BI previously reported (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-voluntary-resignation-employees-relocate-rto-2023-7). Moving more employees to the same locations theoretically means the company can use less office space in non-""hub"" locations.\n\nObviously, if more employees work in the office, a company\'s office vacancy rate should fall.\n\nThe person familiar with the matter also noted that so-called hibernations can help reduce office costs for Amazon. This involves moves such as stopping the use of an entire floor or building to minimize operational expenses like HVAC and lighting. These locations would remain in Amazon\'s office portfolio during hibernation, the person added.\n\nRTO policy\nAmazon\'s Glasser stressed that plans for efficient use of office space are not related to the company\'s RTO policy.\n\n""To suggest that this is about anything else — such as our expectations for working in the office — is at best a misunderstanding and at worst intentionally misleading,"" he told BI.\n\nInternally, Amazon is aware of how last year\'s return-to-office policy caused confusion and frustration among some employees, people familiar with the plans told BI. The rushed announcement and outdated data have led to some buildings being unready (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rto-mandate-shows-some-offices-not-ready-until-september-2023-4) and delays in bringing back people to their offices, these people said.\n\nOn top of that, most of the office space planning is still done manually, using spreadsheets, instead of more sophisticated software tools, one of the people said, which is further complicating the process.\n\nAmazon continues to trim costs in other areas. The latest layoffs took place on Tuesday, when the advertising team cut up to 160 jobs,\nas BI previously reported (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-advertising-hit-with-another-round-layoffs-2024-3)\n.

More than 30,000 employees signed an internal petition (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-return-to-office-policy-petition-30000-staff-remote-work-2023-3), arguing that most of them were hired as fully remote workers during the pandemic.

Banks that provide loans for takeovers generally sell the debt quickly to other investors to get it off their balance sheets, making money on fees.*\n\n*The banks haven’t been able to offload the debt without incurring major losses—largely because of X’s weak financial performance—leaving the loans stuck on their balance sheets, or “hung” in industry jargon.*\n\n*The resulting write-downs have hobbled the banks’ loan books and, in one case, was a factor that crimped compensation for a bank’s merger department, according to people involved with the deal.*\n\n*The value of the loans to Musk quickly soured after the $44 billion acquisition was completed. But new analysis shows how their persistent underperformance has put the deal in historic territory.*\n\n*According to data from PitchBook LCD, the Twitter loans have been hung longer than every similar unsold deal since the 2008-09 financial crisis for which the research firm has complete records.*\n\n*[...] Steven Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago who has tracked such deals since the 1980s, said Twitter isn’t only the biggest hung deal by dollar amount since the 2008 financial crisis but one of the biggest of all time.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*[...] But nearly two years after Musk’s acquisition, X’s business is still struggling to climb out of the deep hole it fell into under his ownership—the company last year said its value had fallen by more than half, to around $19 billion.*\n\n*[...] With the two-year mark on the Twitter loans rapidly approaching, the banks haven’t made moves to sell them, even after some banks have marked the value of the loans down by hundreds of millions of dollars.*\n\n*[...] Because of Twitter and other hung deals, some of the banks also scaled back how much they lent in providing capital for merger-finance deals, according to some of the people.*\n\n*The banks early this year discussed a possible plan to restructure the deal where Musk could pay down some of X’s outstanding debt and the banks would agree to lower interest payments, people familiar with the matter said. X didn’t follow through on the plan, they said.*\n\n*But in the interim, some of Musk’s public comments and tweets have made a sale of the debt more difficult for them given the resulting pressures on the business.*\n\n*At MUFG, Musk’s rant against advertisers in the fall prompted anxiety among senior U.S. executives at the bank, according to people familiar with their thinking.*\n\n*Not long after Musk’s comments, they downgraded the bank’s internal credit rating of the loan—a sign that they don’t think it will be easy to get their money back—and kicked the debt into its special situations and workouts group, which typically handles the debts of bankrupt and financially distressed companies.*', ""I don't understand why the banks loaned Musk that money.

Knowing this can shift focus towards new avenues of research and targeted treatments.', 'Keeping it short: it appears to be genetic.\n\nThis is a pretty robust article getting into the various mechanisms involved but not really providing any insight that is conclusive or useful to a lay person (like me).\n\nGenetics.  Low value take-away if you ask me.', 'Saving the click:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor roughly one in every hundred people, food containing even the smallest amounts of gluten can deliver a gutful of hurt.\r  \n\r  \nWhile a domino effect of immunological reactions can be traced back to their genetic roots, a number of contributing factors are also involved, making it difficult to map the precise chain of events that causes gluten intolerance to emerge.\r  \n\r  \nUsing transgenic mice, an international team led by scientists from McMasters University in Canada has identified a crucial role played by the very cells making up the gut\'s lining, describing a major stepping stone that could lead to new therapies.\r  \n\r  \nCeliac disease is in essence an autoimmune disorder triggered by the presence of a group of structural proteins known as gluten in the intestines.\r  \n\r  \nEating virtually anything made with wheat, barely, or rye – meaning most baked goods, breads, and pastas – puts people with the condition at risk of bloating, pain, diarrhea, constipation, and sometimes reflux and vomiting.\r  \n\r  \nCurrently the only way to avoid the symptoms is to avoid the foods that trigger them.\r  \n\r  \n""The only way we can treat celiac disease today is by fully eliminating gluten from the diet,"" says McMasters gastroenterologist Elena Verdu. ""This is difficult to do, and experts agree that a gluten-free diet is insufficient.""\r  \n\r  \nAround 90 percent of people diagnosed with the condition carry a pair of genes that encode for a protein called HLA-DQ2.5. Of the remaining 10 percent, most have a similar protein called HLA-DQ8.\r  \n\r  \nLike other kinds of \'HLA\' (or human leukocyte antigen) proteins, the proteins hold pieces of fallen invaders aloft like macabre trophies on a class of immune cells, warning other defensive tissues to be on the lookout.\r  \n\r  \nIn the specific case of HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8, the proteins are shaped to hold chunks of gluten peptide that are resistant to digestion, instructing murderous T cells to go on the hunt.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, these instructions aren\'t the clearest at distinguishing between a threat and similar-looking materials in our body, meaning those with the genes are at risk of a variety of autoimmune conditions.\r  \n\r  \nNot everybody who expresses either HLA-DQ2.5 or HLA-DQ8 will develop an immune disorder like celiac disease, however. For that to happen, those torn-up pieces of gluten first need to be carried across the gut wall by a transporting enzyme that binds with the peptide and alters it in ways to make it even more recognizable.\r  \n\r  \nCells in the intestinal wall are responsible for releasing this transporting enzyme into the gut, so they clearly have a critical role in the early stages of the disease. They are also known to express the family of proteins to which HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 belong, which are typically regulated by inflammatory responses in the gut.\r  \n\r  \nWhat hasn\'t been clear is how this staging ground for people with celiac disease actually functions within the pathology itself.\r  \n\r  \nTo focus on this important link in the chain, the research team double-checked the expression of the major immune complex in the cells lining the intestines of people with treated and untreated celiac disease, and in mice with the human genes for HLA-DQ2.5.\r  \n\r  \nThey then created functional living models of the gut, called an organoid, using the mouse intestinal cells in order to study the expression of their immune proteins up close, subjecting them to inflammatory triggers as well as predigested and intact gluten.\r  \n\r  \n""This allowed us to narrow down the specific cause and effect and prove exactly whether and how the reaction takes place,"" says McMasters biomedical engineer Tohid Didar.\r  \n\r  \nFrom this it became evident the cells lining the gut weren\'t just passive bystanders suffering collateral damage in a misguided effort to rid the body of gluten – they were key agents, presenting a mash-up of gluten fragments broken down by gut bacteria and transporting enzymes to gluten-specific immune cells first hand.\r  \n\r  \nKnowing the types of tissue involved and their enhancement by the presence of inflammatory microbes gives researchers a new list of targets for future treatments, potentially allowing millions of people worldwide to enjoy a gluten-filled pastry or two without the risk of discomfort.', ""Summary from what I could figure. It's a good article for someone who already knows how biological experiments work, but not so much for the layperson:\xa0\n\n\nWhat was known before:\xa0\n\n\n- most people with gluten intolerance have one of two specific genes, which makes proteins that basically kidnap a gluten molecule and ransoms it to its family.\xa0\n- these kidnapping proteins will tattle on the gluten molecules whenever it finds some, and tells your immune system to absolutely go ham because its massively xenophobic, which causes the bloating, pain, diarrhea, etc\xa0\n- it was unclear *how* these kidnapper proteins got in contact with your immune system (specifically T cells) but the idea was that your gut cells were just poor damsels caught in the crossfire while the immune\xa0system.\xa0\n\n\nWhat was done in this experiment:\xa0\n\n\n- they put the human genes that make the kidnapper proteins into some rodents, and then isolated some gut cells from them so they could look at those cells super specifically\xa0\xa0\n\n\nWhat was discovered:\xa0\xa0\n\n\n-\xa0 turns out your gut cells are the real rats (pun intended) and they actually emit another protein that lets the kidnappers through to talk to the immune system. Your gut is actually facilitating the immune response (generally, an amazingly *good* thing) but in this case lets the gluten freak-out happen at all\xa0\n- knowing this now lets scientists target something specific to prevent the immune response from even starting. Something like an anti-histamine you might take for pollen allergies is what my mind goes to, but hopefully without like, completely crippling the rest of your gut's immune system in the process""]"

This petition effectively calls for a new law to prevent all similar such situations, where always-online games, both single and multiplayer, can be killed off forever by the developer with no recourse for the consumer. This petition is a result of Ross\' discussions with prominent politicians in the EU, and may potentially largely solve this issue in all EU nations.\n\nIf you\'re an EU citizen, and even *remotely* care about the issue of game publishers and developers permanently killing off game access, or otherwise mandating games require and always-online connection for no apparent reason in many cases (which effectively renders the game unplayable when those publisher/ developer-hosted servers shut down), then I implore you to sign this, as it\'s likely our best chance of pushing back against this practice in the EU, if not ending it outright.\n\nEdit 1: as of this moment, two days following the petition\'s inception, it already has nearly 50,000 signatures, roughly 1/20 of the minimum it needs to pass. The petition is open for a full year. This thing has a very good chance of going through if we get the word out, make people aware, and keep the momentum going.\n\nEdit 2: a common concern that Ross addresses in his video announcing the petition, is whether this may place an undue burden on developers/ publishers, and ESPECIALLY indie developers in providing indefinite support for every title they put out. In practice, this law would minimally impact the developers/ publishers: they would still be free to end official support and servers for their titles whenever they feel the need to. What this law would mandate, is that they provide the players of said games with *some* sort of tools or pathway that would allow for the games to remain in a playable state. A basic example of this could be distribution of tools allowing for fan-hosted servers, or perhaps for single player games to simply drop the \'always-online\' DRM requirement prior to the end of their official support.\n\nEdit 3, August 4th 2024: we\'re sitting at over 155,000 signatures right now.

1806ans,Elon Musk’s X sues media watchdog Media Matters over report on pro-Nazi content on the social media site,,1700533853.0,technology,"['The text of the complaint is kind of funny in its ""saying normal things but in a scary voice"" approach. \n\n&gt; Media Matters executed this plot in multiple steps, as X’s internal investigations have revealed. First, Media Matters accessed accounts that had been active for at least 30 days, bypassing X’s ad filter for new users. Media Matters then exclusively followed a small subset of users consisting entirely of accounts in one of two categories: those known to produce extreme, fringe content, and accounts owned by X’s big-name advertisers.  \n\nAll of the stuff they listed in this paragraph and the following ones is normal use of the website. Having an account for 30 days, following racists, viewing big brands, scrolling endlessly and refreshing... That\'s just what X is. There is no secret hack to making this happen.\n\n&gt; Media Matters could have produced a fair, accurate account of users’ interactions with advertisements on X via basic reporting: following real users, documenting the actual, organic production of content and advertisement pairings.\n\nI\'m sure Media Matters would love to comprehensively examine the actual organic production of content and advertisement pairings, but I\'m guessing X isn\'t going to open their books to allow that, ever. So, Media Matters created an account that they could document, ran it through its paces, and found evidence of this happening. That is a valid reporting approach.\n\n&gt; \\47. Defendant Media Matters made these statements as statements of fact, not opinion. Defendant Media Matters represented that X “has been placing” advertisements next to antiSemitic and racist materials. It represented that it “found” these materials next to advertisements.\n\n&gt; \\48. As extensively explained above, these statements made by Defendant Media Matters were false.\n\nThis isn\'t a lawsuit. It\'s a press release in the shape of a lawsuit to make it sound more authentic, filed in Texas because the Fifth Circuit doesn\'t enforce anti-SLAPP laws.\n\nThey confirm that Media Matters was actually served ads next to racist material. Media Matters didn\'t splice images or inspect elements to add the ""Promoted"" tag or hide posts between the ads and the racist stuff. ""Well, they had to refresh a lot"" and ""those were accounts they followed"" doesn\'t change the fact that X placed ads and Media Matters found them. Low probability events are still valid events in the context of things that happen. \n\nX\'s complaint is just the vibes of the situation, that Media Matters made it seem like this was common when it was actually super rare. You usually don\'t sue for the vibes and, beyond that, Media Matters never said it was common. ""We recently found ads for Apple, Bravo, Oracle, Xfinity, and IBM next to posts that tout Hitler and his Nazi Party on X"" followed by five screenshots is different from stating the frequency of something occurring. \n\nI\'m guessing X claims victory when the advertisers comes back and this gets quietly withdrawn before any discovery (esp. the documents about the investigation, which probably show which ads were actually adjacent to racist material).', 'Discovery will not go well for him, and I think I speak for everyone when I say I am ready to die of popcorn overconsumption.']"

You have to increase the collective pitch on the blades to maintain equilibrium, resulting in an increase power required from the engines.\n\n2) The lower density air going in to the engines means less efficient combustion. The engines burn hotter for a given power output, resulting in less power available.\n\nEvery helicopter has an equilibrium point where power required = power available. In cold, low density altitude air, that equilibrium is at a higher altitude or gross weight.\n\nAs density altitude increases, power available decreases and power required increases, moving that equilibrium down.\n\nAt some density altitude you get to the point where the power required to fly exceeds the power available.']"

Now the entire story is moot. WTF is going on at Tesla.', 'Genius move that us mere mortals could never hope to understand\xa0', ""&gt;So successful is the Supercharger network that, over the course of last year, virtually every other automaker that sells or plans to sell EVs in the US has announced it will drop the CCS1 connector for the J3400 standard, originally developed by Tesla. But those announcements were about more than just switching plugs. Each time, the OEM also revealed it had negotiated access for its customers to the Supercharger network.\n&gt;\n&gt;That made Musk's dismissal of the entire team responsible so hard to fathom. While the Supercharger network accounts for only about 5 percent of Tesla's revenues, that percent is poised to grow as more OEMs gain access. And although the charging experience for Tesla EVs at Superchargers is usually flawless, that's because it's optimized for a single make of car with just five different models; there's no guarantee that will prove true when cars from other brands try to charge.\n&gt;\n&gt;The layoffs also appeared to put Tesla's plan to build a more powerful charger that would benefit cars using 800 V or 900 V architectures, including Audi, Porsche, Lucid, and others, on hold.\n&gt;\n&gt;Worse yet, dozens of Supercharger sites that were in the works have stalled out, according to multiple reports.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;This is not the first time Musk has had to back-track an impetuous business decision. In 2019, he decided to close all of Tesla's retail locations to pay for a cheaper version of the Model 3 sedan.

6cvg82,Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

If we start referring to those who do not support net neutrality as people that are anti-Netflix, or anti-YouTube, and can make one of those the coloquial term, the general populace may start to care. \n\nIt needs to be taken a step further though, the American people need to realize that taking away net neutrality is in fact a method of limiting free speech. It could be called ""anti-Netflix"" legislation or ""pay-per-speak"" legislation. \n\nPeople need to be aware that this is not a matter of politics. Whether they identify as a democrat, republican, or any number of the minority parties, this is something that can be used to limit free speech.\n\nSteps to help:\n\n1. Learn the analogy of roads to explain net neutrality\n\n2. Explain the corporate motivation for ending net neutrality\n\n3. Refer to it as ""anti-Netflix"" or ""pay-per-speak"" legislation\n\n4. Explain that you believe Internet access is the same as any utility, and not a luxury service\n\nOrganization and awareness are the only way we can say net neutrality.

Johnson sets the precedent for freedom expression is protected speech and that the use of the internet is a vehicle for the freest form of expression possible.

This morning, it announced a notice of proposed rulemaking it dubs “click to cancel,” requiring companies to make ending a subscription equivalently simple to signing up for one. That includes letting people use the same method for both actions — so a business can’t, for instance, let someone sign up for a service online but make them call a phone number to cancel.\n\nThe rule has a couple of other provisions. Many companies try to keep subscribers by offering special deals or perks, and they’re still allowed to do that, but they must offer an up-front opt-out that lets customers bypass the sales pitches. They also have to annually remind consumers that they’re enrolled in what are dubbed “negative option” programs, or programs where failing to cancel something is considered an agreement to keep paying, for anything but physical goods. Now, the agency has opened a public comment period for the proposal, after which it will potentially make revisions and pass the final regulation.\n\n“Companies should not be able to manipulate consumers into paying for subscriptions that they don’t want,” FTC chair Lina Khan told reporters in advance of the announcement. “We get countless complaints about this.”\n\nThat likely includes complaints for such popular services as Amazon Prime, which had to simplify its cancelation process last year in the EU under regulatory pressure. It’s also been a perennial irritation for people who start paying for The New York Times, gym memberships, cable service, and countless other subscription categories.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them.

**[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22. 

**There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com**

**We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**

6e8wta,Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well,"FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)

* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

It's on page 2,201.

The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant. It would even let foreign governments wiretap inside the U.S. without having to comply with U.S. Wiretap Act restrictions.

fkzfzq,Reject the anti-encryption bill. These Senators are trying to damage privacy &amp; security while everyone is distracted with Coronavirus! EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators.,"[**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

While  the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have  been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security.

Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be  read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle  such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d  lose  legal protections that allow them to operate.

[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

That’s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security)   away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,”   meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney   General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban   encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message. This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies.

The EARN IT bill had  its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters’  strategy is clear. Because  they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to  insist it doesn’t affect encryption.

“This  bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said  at today’s hearing. “Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness.

It’s  true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption.  It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by  the  Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\]   what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law   enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.

You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.

The  19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of   best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.

The Commission won’t be a  body that seriously considers policy; it  will be a vehicle for creating  a law enforcement wish list. Barr has  made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once   it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as   they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not   just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those   governments want to suppress. 

The  privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law  enforcement  is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption.  Senators should  reject the EARN IT bill.

But these drones have been flying over the Minneapolis protests (and the riots) since day one.

There is a lot of misleading info being thrown along here. \nFirst, the aircraft could be called a predator, because everything made by Gnereral Atomics is considered sitting that family. However, the plane is most accurately described as an MQ-9 Reaper.\nSecond, regarding armament, forget it, it\'s not happening. The plane is being operated by Customs and Border Protection, not the DoD. This means the plane is a demilitarized model and lacks the hardware and software to carry munitions. It would cost most time and money to equip this airplane to carry missiles than it would to just buy a new airplane. The wings would have to be replaced to carry hard points, the payload equipment would need to be replaced to enable the plane to provide guidance for the missile. It just wouldn\'t happen.\nWhy drones? The plane doesn\'t have any particular advantage over a manned airplane except the fact it can loiter a long time. It\'s not ""nearly invisible"" or equipped with any spooky tracking equipment. It\'s only advantage is that it\'s streamlined to save gas and the crew can be easily rotated out for rest quicker than the airplane. So it can stay on station for longer. That\'s it.', 'Why is that aircraft carrier in Minneapolis?']"

Problem is, the smartphone market is pretty stable, and they\'ll never be able to outspend Apple, so they bet on VR as being the next big thing they could innovate in as there really aren\'t many large companies in the space spending lots of resources into it.\n\nHonesty, my guess is that this was somewhat in the works since they bought oculus, since back then investors just went apeshit for anything with ""VR"" in it, but they\'ve had to lean into it due to their revenue taking a big hit after Apple let users opt out of tracking data.\n\nWhat\'s extra funny to me is that I\'m a developer, and I really can\'t overstate how terrible the support is if you want to make apps for the oculus platform.

He’s a 34-year-old Massachusetts dad who wears corny cat T-shirts and a collection of headbands while running his “Roaring Kitty” YouTube channel from the basement of his rented residence. Known as “DeepF---kingValue” on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, Gill worked in marketing for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. before sending shock waves through the financial firmament.\n\n&gt; “I didn’t expect this,” Gill told the Wall Street Journal in his first interview since his GameStop evangelizing made him incredibly rich in the span of a few days. “I thought this trade would be successful,” he said, “but I never expected what happened over the past week.” Gill shared a screenshot of his brokerage account Wednesday showing a roughly $20 million daily gain on his GameStop stock and options after the company’s shares hit intraday high of $380, The Journal reported. Another screenshot shared Thursday showed a $15 million loss.\n\n&gt; Gill has championed GameStop for months and posted a celebratory YouTube video Jan. 22 when its stock closed at $65 per share after hovering around $19 at the start of January. Wearing his signature headband, matching wristband and aviator sunglasses, he sipped from a flute of Prosecco and thanks his fellow traders for their insights and “ongoing support.” “Thank you, to all of you, for so much,” he said. “It’s really important you understand how I feel and how my family feels.”\n\n&gt; Beyond Gill’s promotion of GameStop, the retail traders who flocked to the stock this week also were drawn by the bearish bets hedge fund managers made. Those positions, known as shorts, presented an opportunity — if enough small time buyers managed to push GameStop’s price above a certain point, the hedge fund managers would be forced to exit their positions at a loss. The squeeze scheme worked, turning Gill into an everyman icon. “(Gill) will go down as the greatest legend in the history of WallStreetBets,” Jon Hagedorn, a 34-year-old training supervisor based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., told WSJ. “He’s the original OG,” Hagerdorn said.\n\n&gt;“This story is so much bigger than me,” Gill told The Journal. “I support these retail investors, their ability to make a statement.” He started investing in GameStop around June 2019, when it was trading around $5 a share. He considered it undervalued, liked its fundamentals and believed it was poised to “pivot” and regain momentum. “He always liked money,” his mom Elaine Gill told WSJ. She said when her son was young, “he would get money from those scratch tickets that people didn’t know they’d won. People would throw them on the ground…A lot of times there was still money on them.” Still a resident of Gill’s hometown of Brockton, Mass., the mom said she was worried her son might get in trouble for being at the center of the week’s market mania. “The first thing that I had asked him when this craziness started was: is this illegal or anything dishonest? He said, ‘No mom, it’s not,’” she said. “I’m not out for anybody,” Gill told the Wall Street Journal. “Roaring Kitty was an educational channel where I was showcasing my investment philosophy.”\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, Gill, the father of a 2-year-old daughter, said he was still mulling his future options thanks to his newfound wealth. He hopes to continue “Roaring Kitty” and maybe buy a house. “I always wanted to build an indoor track facility or a field house in Brockton,” he said. “And now, it looks like I actually could do that.”', 'I guess things really \\*did\\* start working out for old Gill.', '[removed]']"

""We are not people to Mark Zuckerberg, we are the product and we are being used against each other out of greed.\n\n""Yost said in the press release that he hopes to recover the pension fund\'s losses with the lawsuit as well as ensure that the company ""makes significant reforms"" to avoid misleading the public again.\n\nA Facebook representative said: ""This suit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.""\n\nMonday\'s filing is likely the first major lawsuit against the company since Haugen first leaked thousands of internal discussions, memos, and research to federal regulators and the media. Among the trove of materials are instances when Facebook knew its products were unhealthy and potentially dangerous for teen users but undermined efforts to counteract that harm.\n\nHaugen testified before Congress that the company chooses "" profits over safety.""\n\nThe company has maintained that the documents do not paint a complete picture of Meta and its safety efforts. Its share price has fallen roughly 9% since the first ""Facebook Papers"" reports began to publish in September.\n\nMonday\'s lawsuit is also among the first in what experts say is likely to be a flurry of legal action against Meta. Analyst Blair Levin told Insider in October that class action lawsuits — like the handful that have already been filed —  and investigations led by state attorneys general like Yost could be more dire threats than any new federal regulation from Congress.\n\nThat\'s because the court could force Meta to make more internal documents public,  which could ""yield even more problematic evidence for Facebook,"" Levin said.\n\nYost was previously one of 40 state attorneys general who in May wrote a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg pleading for the company to ax plans to roll out an Instagram version for kids.\n\nInstagram contended that the kids-centric app would allow parents to better supervise and control their children\'s experiences.

I\'ve met a whole slew of people who think any government oversight is bad, consequences be damned.

The open internet has broad, bipartisan support –\nonly utility regulation is controversial. Congress has clear constitutional authority to permanently protect the open\ninternet\n\nOh, okay. So until someone figures out how to pass a country wide speed limit for the roads, we\'ll just take down all the speed limit signs, because don\'t worry, they\'ll get around to fixing it.\n\n&gt;Myth: Utility regulation protects consumers from monopoly internet providers.\nFact: Between wired, wireless, and satellite service, consumers have more options for internet service than ever. In\n2015, 95% of consumers had three or more choices for service at 13-20 Mbps and even even under the critics’ most\nskewed definition counting only wired service exceeding 25 Mbps as “internet” nearly 40% of consumers have two or\nmore choices of provider.\n\nI don\'t even understand the argument they\'re trying to make here, because I\'m pretty sure they made my point for me. Literally more than half of the consumers in the country has one (or fewer...) choices for broadband internet. Yes, we do make the choice to cut it off at 25Mbps, because that\'s literally your fucking [definition](https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7932653/fcc-changed-definition-broadband-25mbps).

rlfxa8,"Facebook's reputation is so bad, the company must pay even more now to hire and retain talent. Some are calling it a 'brand tax' as tech workers fear a 'black mark' on their careers.",,1640097253.0,technology,"['Bypass Paywall: \n\nA series of scandals and missteps has damaged Facebook\'s reputation so much that the company is being forced to pay ever larger compensation to hire and retain workers, according to industry recruiters, former employees, and data reviewed by Insider.\n\nThe company has always competed aggressively for talent, and the tech job market in general is on fire. But a deteriorating public image means the social-media giant now has to outbid other major tech companies, such as Google.\n\n""One thing Facebook can still do is pay a lot more,"" said Jose Guardado, an experienced tech recruiter and the founder of Build Talent. ""They can easily throw more compensation at people they currently have, and cover any brand tax and pay a little more to get people to come on."" \n\nSilicon Valley companies thrive or whither based on their ability to recruit the smartest employees. Without a steady influx of engineers and other technical experts, new products and important updates take longer to release, and rivals can quickly get ahead. Then there\'s the financial cost: In 2022, Facebook projected, expenses could jump as high as $97 billion from $70 billion this year, in large part because of ""investments in technical and product talent."" A company spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther companies, and even whole industries, have had to increase compensation to overcome hiring and retention problems caused by scandal and shifting public perceptions, said Alan Johnson, a managing director at the compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates. ""If you\'re an oil company, if you make cigarettes, if you\'re in cattle or Wells Fargo, sure,"" he said. \n\nHow well this is working for Facebook is debatable as the company has more than 4,300 open jobs and has seen decreasing rates of acceptance on job offers, according to internal documents reported by Protocol. It\'s also seen dozens of high-level executives leave this year, and recruiters say employees are now more open to considering jobs elsewhere. Facebook used to be a place that people rarely left, given its reach, pay, and perks.\n\nA former Oculus engineer who left last year said Facebook could now be seen as a ""black mark"" on someone\'s career. A hardware engineer who exited in 2020 shared similar sentiments: They said they quit because of concerns about misinformation on the platform and the effect of that on children. Another employee said their department was dissolved in late 2019 by Facebook and, although the company offered another position that paid more, they left last year anyway for a different industry. The workers, and many other people who spoke with Insider for this story, asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the topic. \n\nFor those who stick around and people who take new jobs at Facebook, base pay and stock grants have gone up a ""sizable"" amount in the past year, said Zuhayeer Musa, cofounder of Levels.fyi, a platform that collects pay data based on verified offers and compensation disclosures.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the median compensation for an upper-mid-level engineer, an E5, was $400,000, up from $380,000 a year earlier. For an E4, the median pay jumped to $276,000 from $256,000 in the same period. For both groups, the increases were double the gains between 2018 and 2019, Levels.fyi data showed.\n\nMusa, who\'s firm also offers pay-negotiation coaching, said previously that the total compensation ceiling for an E5 engineer at Facebook was $450,000. ""We recently had a client get up to $510,000 for E5,"" he added.\n\nEquity awards at the company are getting more generous, too. At the group-director and VP levels, Facebook staff are getting $3 million to $6 million in restricted stock units each year, another tech recruiter said. Directors and managers are getting on average $1 million a year. In engineering, a high-level engineer is getting $600,000 in stock and a $75,000 bonus, while even an entry-level engineer is getting $50,000 to $100,000 in stock and a $20,000 to $50,000 bonus, Levels.fyi data indicated.\n\nEven compared to Google, Facebook\'s stock awards are generous and increasing, Levels.fyi data shows. While base pay is about the same, Facebook offers more in stock grants, significantly increasing total compensation. At Google, entry-level equity awards range from $20,000 to $38,000, while Facebook grants are worth $40,000 to $60,000. Sign-on bonuses at Facebook are often about $50,000, while Google gives about $20,000, according to the data.\n\n""It\'s not normal, but it\'s consistent with the craziness that\'s happening in the market right now,"" said Aalap Shah, a managing director focused on the tech industry at the consulting firm Pearl Meyer.\n\nIn an October post to Blind, an app that lets employees anonymously share information as long as they have a verified work email address, an engineer with offers from Facebook and Google asked for advice on which job to accept. The person said Google offered a base salary of $134,000, a $20,000 signing bonus, and $100,000 in stock. Facebook offered $129,000 in salary, a $50,000 signing bonus, and $150,000 in stock. Still, those who responded almost unanimously suggested that the person accept Google\'s offer, given the less stressful culture at Google and the ""toxic"" environment at Facebook.\n\nCompared to other companies, like Amazon, Facebook ""has been increasing base salary much more significantly,"" Musa said, while also outbidding all competing offers a person may receive.\n\n""Generally most large companies have significantly increased compensation over the last year,"" he added. ""But Facebook has been outbidding candidates on their competing offers to close them faster. So they\'ve had higher ceilings. ""\n\nFacebook\'s pay ""handily beats all the other FAANG companies,"" one tech worker wrote earlier this year in a separate post on Blind. (FAANG refers to the US tech companies Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix , and Google.) The person asked why Facebook was willing to pay so much. ""It helps us ignore the company\'s failings, and all of the ways we\'re damaging the world,"" a verified Facebook worker responded. Another wrote, ""Google has the better name so they can get away with lowballing more.""\n\nEquity vesting occurs monthly at Facebook these days, at a rate of 25% a year, and it starts immediately when a person is hired, said recruiters, industry experts, and many posts discussing compensation on Blind. \n\n""You\'ve essentially just given them another base salary,"" Shah said, adding this is not a long-term incentive strategy. ""It\'s just cash.""\n\nFor the first four years at Facebook, RSUs are ""refreshed"" annually at an amount dependent on a person\'s job level and performance. Posts on Blind said refresher grants for engineers ranged from $45,000 to about $440,000 and could be multiplied for good performance. An employee deemed to have done ""redefining"" work in their role would see their refresher grant tripled, for example. Someone who had merely ""met expectations"" would receive the same amount as their initial grant. \n\nFactor in all of that, and a Facebook employee could ostensibly be paid three or four times their base salary. When you get to the group-director level and executive ranks at Facebook, a recruiter said, the stock awards accumulate so much after a few years that a person can be worth upward of $100 million dollars and never need to work again.\n\n""Facebook employees are highly valuable, absolutely,"" said Greg Selker, head of the North America technology practice at the executive recruiting firm Stanton Chase. ""But the longer an executive stays at Facebook, the more difficult it will be to distance themselves from the negative impact of the decisions being made there.""\n\nBut at that level, having made so much money already, a dent in the résumé may not matter.', 'Facebook\'s recruitment team is fully aware of this for quite some time already.\n\nIn the beginning of 2019 I was approached by a Facebook recruiter for a position in their London office. I was fully aware of Facebook\'s bad reputation but I decided to go along because I really needed a new job back then.\n\nI went through the entire process and I received an offer from them in the end. Around the same time I was interviewing with a different small company and I also received and offer from them and I decided to accept the offer from the small company.\n\nWhen I told Facebook\'s recruiter that I was declining their offer to accept an offer from a small company, she asked me why so I kindly explained to the recruiter that Facebook\'s reputation was playing a big role in my decision.\n\nThe recruiter thanked me for the input and I thought the story would end there. But two days later Facebook\'s recruiter called me again to say that they were increasing the offer and also to say:\n\n""I understand that you don\'t think highly of our reputation, but I just want to highlight that this is NOT an opportunity to work in the Facebook or Instagram apps; this is an opportunity to work on WhatsApp, one the most loved apps in the whole world"".\n\nIt was funny to see a Facebook recruiter trying to distance themselves from two of their most used apps in order to convince me to join the company.']"

Meanwhile, since Sal and Ricks were buying hundreds of cars a year, they’d have some leverage against the manufacturers.\n\nAlso, the argument was that if Ford and GM controlled the retail market, they’d easily raise prices, make more money and use that money to take even more control of the political process. A lot of these rules were set up to ensure local communities could economically survive and as a defense against fascism.\n\nI’m not saying the structure played out perfectly, but that was the goal.\n\n***Edit: A handful of people are asking about the fascism connection. I\'ll expand here.***\n\nThe general framework I\'m describing is popularly known anti-monopoly. From the 1930s until the 1970s it was a major bedrock of American politics. Wilson and FDR (both Democrats) were the major drivers at the Federal level, but it became a bipartisan ideology. If you\'re interested in its historical evolution and decline, I\'d recommend Matt Stoller\'s ""[How Democrats Killed Their Populist Soul](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/).""\n\nThere is a 100% direct link between anti-monopoly policy and fighting back against fascism. It\'s mostly been forgotten, but fascism in general, and Mussolini in particular, was incredibly popular with many wealthy Americans. Andrew Mellon, Treasury Secretary under 3 Republican administrations effectively campaigned for him. After visiting him in Italy, Mellon told American journalists that Mussolini, ""is one of the most remarkable of men, and his grasp of world affairs is most comprehensive. If he carries out his program, in which the whole world is vitally interested, he will have accomplished a miracle and ensure himself a conspicuous place in history.""\n\nThe following sections are from the [Curse of Bigness](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/books/63/) by Tim Wu. The first is him quoting Tennesse Senator Estes Kefauver, who is debating the passage of [the anti-merger act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celler%E2%80%93Kefauver_Act) (emphasis mine). It\'s a good peak at the ideological stakes.\n\n&gt;Later, Wu summarizes the driving ideology behind the anti-monopoly policy. e in. The present trend of great corporations to increase their economic power is the antithesis of m (emphasis mine). It\'s a good peek at the ideological stakes.gers the people are losing power to direct their own economic welfare. **When they lose the power to direct their economic welfare they also lose the means to direct their political future**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am not an alarmist, but the history of what has taken place in other nations where mergers and concentrations have placed economic control in the hands of a very few people is too clear to pass over easily. A point is eventually reached, and we are rap-idly reaching that point in this country, where the public steps in to take over when concentration and monopoly gain too much power. **The taking over by the public through its government always follows one or two methods and has one or two political results. It either results in a Fascist state or the nationalization of industries and thereafter a Socialist or Communist state.**\n\nBasically, if markets are allowed to concentrate, people lose control of their democracy which inevitably results in Fascism or Communism. FDR basically neutered communism in America with the creation of the National Labor Relations Board, but it was a lot harder to stem fascism. After all, its major proponents are all rich.\n\nLater, Wu summarizes the link between anti-monopoly policy and fascism.\n\n&gt;But the real political support for the laws in the postwar period came from the fact that they were understood as a bulwark against the terrifying examples of Japan, Italy, and most of all the Third Reich. As antitrust scholar Daniel Crane writes, “the post-War currents of democracy-enhancing antitrust ide-ology arose in the United States and Europe in reaction to the role that concentrated economic power played in stimulating the rise of fascism.” Thurman Arnold was more blunt: “Germany became organized to such an extent that a Fuehrer was inevitable; had it not been Hitler it would have been someone else.”']"

gp976i,"Roughly half the Twitter accounts pushing to 'reopen America' are bots, researchers found",,1590256067.0,technology,"['EDIT: Links below are NSFW.\n\nI mod a NSFW here on reddit with a different account. Until me and a few others stepped up to help moderate, about 90% of the content was pushed via automatic bots, and this trend also follows on several other NSFW subs. The sub I mod is about 150k users, so think for a minute how much spam that is based on how often people post.\n\nThese bots actually post relative (albeit recycled) content. So usually mods have no real reason to look closer, until you realize that the same content is getting recycled every ~2 weeks or so. So upon taking a closer look, you will notice all of these accounts follow the exact same trend, some obvious, some not so obvious.\n\nFor starters, almost all of these bots have the same username structure. It\'s usually something like ""FirstnameLastname"", like they have a list of hundreds of names and are just stitching them together randomly to make usernames. Almost all of these bots will go straight to /r/FreeKarma4U to build up comment karma. Most Automoderator rules use some form of comment karma or combined karma to block new accounts. This allows the bot to get past a common rule.\n\nThe bot then is left idle for anywhere from a week to a month. Another common Automoderator rule is account age, and by leaving the bot idle, it gains both age as well as karma. So as of right now, the bot can get past most common filters, and proceeds to loop through dozens of NSFW subs, posting link after link until it gets site banned. It can churn out hundreds of posts a day.\n\nSome exceptions to the above process I\'ve found. Some bots will \'fake\' a comment history. They go around looking for people who just reply to a comment that says ""what/wut/wat"" and then just repeat the comment above them (I\'m also wondering if some of these users posting ""what"" are also bots). With the size of a site like reddit, it can quickly create a comment history that, at first glance, looks to be pretty normal. But as soon as you investigate any of the comments, you realize they are all just parroting. [Here is an example of a bot like this](https://www.reddit.com/user/DigestSkate/comments/). Note the ""FirstnameLastname"" style username. If you, as a mod, glance at these comments, you\'d think that this user looks real, except click on the context or permalinks for each comment, and you\'ll see that each comment is a reply to a \'what\' comment.\n\nAnother strange approach I\'ve seen is using /r/tumblr. I\'ve seen bots make a single comment on a /r/tumblr post, which then somehow amasses like 100-200 karma. The account sits for a bit, then goes on its spam rampage. Not sure if this approach is using bot accounts to upvote these random, innocuous comments, but I\'ve banned a ton of bots that just have a singular comment in /r/tumblr. [Here\'s an example](https://www.reddit.com/user/LeonardoFerrer/). Rapid-fire pornhub posts, with a single /r/tumblr comment. Again, username is ""FirstnameLastname"".\n\nEDIT 2: Quick clarification:\n\n&gt;It\'s usually something like ""FirstnameLastname"", \n\nMore accurate to say it\'s something like ""FirstwordSecondword"". Not necessarily a name, though I\'ve seen names used as well as mundane words. This is also not exclusively used; I recall seeing a format like ""Firstword-Secondword"" a while ago, as well as bots that follow a similar behavior, but not a similar naming structure.', 'Pretty sure half of the internet is bots at this point.

What saddens me is that this is probably closer to the truth, Reddit isn't a platform of speech and debate it's just another advertising board, and as long as the money is rolling in, who cares?"", '\n**Full article for those who dont want to disable ad blockers**\n\nReddit is being regularly manipulated by large financial services companies with fake accounts and fake upvotes via seemingly ordinary internet marketing agencies.\n\n“I work with a number of accounts on Reddit that we can use to change the conversation. And make it a bit more positive.”\n\nThis was the startling admission of a professional-looking marketing agency that, in a phone call with me, openly bragged about manipulating conversations on Reddit.\n\nThis wasn’t a one-off, nor was it the result of weeks of plumbing the depths of the dark web looking for shilling services. Finding this agency, and several others, took less than a few hours of basic Googling.\n\nImage credit: Jay McGregor\nImage credit: Jay McGregor\n\n\nThe business of Internet shilling - posing as a genuine forum user but being in the employ of a corporation to promote their work - is booming. And it has been for a long time. From fake Amazon reviews to the U.S Army astroturfing social media, comment manipulation is as old as the very concept of internet forums.\n\nFake comments and fake conversations being hard to spot, especially when they’re made by specialist agencies, makes shilling big business.\n\nNowhere is this more apparent than on Reddit. Being the world’s 22nd most popular website and the U.S.’ 7th makes it a popular target because of the hundreds of millions of eyeballs it attracts every month.\n\nIn December last year, I managed to place two entirely fake news stories onto influential subreddits - with millions of subscribers - and vote them to the top with fake accounts and fake upvotes for less than $200. It was simple, cheap and effective. \n\nWe created fake Brexit news and got it to top of an influential subreddit with fake votes. Image credit: Jay McGregor\nWe created fake Brexit news and got it to top of an influential subreddit with fake votes. Image credit: Jay McGregor\n\nWhat I hadn’t realised at the time was how widespread this shilling issue was. Professional marketing agencies, with offices in several different countries, offer these services often under the guise of ""reputation management."" They don’t specifically talk about manipulating conversations online, instead using coded, dog whistle language like “targeted techniques” and “competitor slander.”\n\nBut, to verify that these companies are selling professional forum manipulation services, I had to get in contact. So I developed a back story and called a few agencies.\n\nContinued from page 1\n\nThe first UK-based agency I spoke to was more candid than the language on its website. A representative brazenly told me that it had handled “multinational and multilingual” campaigns for forex (financial and currency exchange) companies. As if it was an everyday, pedestrian activity to wage war on authentic discourse on behalf of a faceless corporation.\n\nWhen pressed on his exact methods, he explained “Well there\'s different IP addresses, they have real emails behind them that aren\'t anything to do with your company at all, different avatars, you know, if you can tell me roughly what they\'re saying, we can rework it so it looks natural. So we\'ll make an effort to make it look natural.”\n\nHe continued, “I work with a number of accounts on Reddit as well that we can use and just, basically, change the conversation. And make it a bit more positive. We can get rid of the negative thread and just start a new thread”.\n\nHe didn’t go into specifics of which companies - and didn’t offer links to previous campaigns even after I repeatedly asked, explaining that he valued customer privacy. Which is why I’ve chosen to not name the agencies, because I can’t verify the work they’ve done outside of the claims the agencies themselves have made.\n\nThis is part of the problem, despite the efforts of myself, and the Point team, we couldn’t find obvious fake comments, despite it clearly being widespread. These are, after all, professional services and all boast about their ability to blend in. If we’re specifically looking for fake comments and find none, how can the average user?\n\nFor this particular service, I was quoted £1200 per month for unlimited conversation and vote manipulation. This wasn’t a one-off, at least four other agencies offered similar services. These aren’t underground, single-person organisations running out of their parents’ basement. These are professional, fully staffed companies with international offices and, ostensibly, fee-paying clients.\n\nAnother agency offer 100 comments for $150. Image credit: Jay McGregor\nAnother agency offer 100 comments for $150.

The best way to combat this bullcrap is dont let a couple quick downvotes scare you into deleting the comment. People still outnumber these assholes and their propaganda.""]"

The difficulty of Bitcoin mining increases with the number of people doing it. Blocks are mined about every 10 minutes. There is a block reward of 6.25 BTC per block mined.... But with BTC now over $40k, that means that every block found rewards it's finder with $250k. Every 10 minutes. It's as if Tesla decided to release 300 new shares every 10 minutes, yet still the price goes up!\n\nSo since miners essentially turn electricity into blocks, this high block reward incentives miners to use as much cheap electricity as they can. Bitcoin's energy footprint is directly related to it's price (and the block reward). As long as price goes up, so does it's energy footprint.\n\nIf there's a silver lining, it's that the protocol developers designed the reward to decrease over time and eventually be eliminated. The block reward is halved (roughly) every 4 years, so in 20 years the block reward will be a shade under .2 BTC. For the block rewards to be equivalent to right now, BTC would have to be worth $1.25 million by then. Seems unlikely, but back in 2012 when I first started getting into it BTC at $40k seemed unlikely, too.""]"

apu3oz,"With the recent Chinese company, Tencent, in the news about investing in Reddit, and possible censorship, it's amazing to me how so many people don't realize Reddit is already one of the most heavily censored websites on the internet.","I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&amp;#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit.

43fi39,I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for,"https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have &gt;500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.

Having said all that, you just can’t compare the purchasing power the US or EU has with Brazil reality. This is one of the reasons apple has to do something different in Brazil.

You\'d think the EU would also be very unhappy about that if that\'s the case.\n\n\nEdit: Lots of responses, best I can make from them is that NO there is not some sort of ""hard physical limit"" of 50,000 satellites in LEO and theoretically it could support millions of satellites. However there are real and valid concerns about how crowded this piece of space is getting with an increased risk in collisions, which due to a lack of international cooperation and regulation does seem to pose some sort of soft cap currently. Ultimately a program to clean up debris and coordinate against collisions will be necessary, but the US will enjoy a much better position in those due to the current ""first mover"" advantage.

6ivklm,"Net neutrality day of action update: Twitter, Soundcloud, and Medium, have joined. Reddit, This could be as big as SOPA.","Hey reddit, I wanted to give another quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** planned for July 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and Internet users are helping organize.

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them.

2duzfi,Comcast’s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,"*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “Unreturned” equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast’s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast’s fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible &amp; overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, &amp; International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.

Teleperformance, which has more than 42,000 workers in Colombia, did not respond to Insider\'s request for comment. \n\nWhy am I not surprised? Of course it\'s fucking teleperformance.\n\nFor those who doesn\'t know what a teleperformance is, just a simple google search (make sure to scroll through the sponsored SEO results a bit) and you will see pages upon pages of horrible review on sites like Indeed or Glassdoor. If you think Tesla\'s treatment of its megafactory workers or Amazon warehouse people\'s pee bottle were evil, I can guarantee you that teleperformance is the spawn of Satan, or worse, the Devil himself.\n\nI worked for teleperformance during a difficult period of my life. It was either teleperformance call center or the street, but at times, I wish I were homeless. To quote a co-worker of mine who got out of the job within the first month to get a janitor of at the local highschool: ""I would rather clean all of my school\'s toilet bowl with my tongue than returning to that hellish job."" If you look up the definition of ""neo-colonialism"" in a dictionary, you might find a picture of a teleperformance call center in there, along with maybe the picture of its founder, daniel julien.\n\nTheir business model is basically just offshoring, oursourcing shitty jobs that nobody in the first world would like to do, make it 10x worse, then shove it down the throat of desperate people in the third world for a tiny fraction of what they charged their clients. Then, to top it off, they would hire an army of bloodthirsty, sadist slave-drivers (also known as ""managers"" by us peons in the sweatshop) to make sure they make their workers\' life as hellish as possible (and bring out every ounce of productivity they can from them, but at times I feel like it only takes second priority to the former).\n\nAs a result, things such as catching your coworker crying in the restroom or people quitting daily were the norm, and not the exception. I even created this account during those days of suffering. My Reddit username is a word play on the word ""no way out"" in my mother tongue, because I seriously considered taking my life during that period. It was that bad. \n\nAt least teleperformance provided me with a massive drive to study and find something better and I attributed a ton of how I got my current IT job to this pissy job in this shitty company. Thanks, daniel julien /s. Also, thanks to the fact that they got to the Top 25 spot in Fortune 100\'s Best Companies to Work For Globally, that I now know that award is worth less than a piece of horse shit, thanks teleperformance, you played not only yourself but others, great job! /s\n\nHowever, every time I got bored enough these days to look up teleperformance on the net, they never failed to amaze me with the depths of depravity they managed to sink to. I thought the way management ""soft-approved"" our off-day only to reject it 15 minutes before the supposed off-day was bad enough (I\'m sure they did it for shit and giggles, it happened close to 100% of the time so it can\'t be coincidence). Last time I look them up? They forced a whole call center to work in the same room as a corpse. \n\nDon\'t believe me? Read those:\n[Teleperformance let a worker to die on the job and forced his co-workers to keep working next to the lifeless body](https://uit-ci.org/index.php/2021/07/27/teleperformance-let-a-worker-to-die-on-the-job-and-forced-his-co-workers-to-keep-working-next-to-the-lifeless-body/?lang=en)\n[Something unbelievable happened in Teleperformance-Dominican Republic](https://www.reddit.com/r/callcentres/comments/ol52mv/something_unbelievable_happened_in/)\n\nOf course they tried to bury it with SEO, and because this story is about a no-name worker from a no-name country in a no-name call center, nobody cared enough to make it an international headline, but with some dedication and the right keywords you can look it up on Google. And I refuse to let his name be forgotten. \n\nHis name was Luis Pimentel. His story:\n\n&gt; The French transnational Teleperformance has committed one of the most unusual abuses against the working class that we have witnessed in our country. Workers have denounced through social networks that their co-worker Luis Pimentel suffered a heart attack at 9 pm on 12 July at the Larimar headquarters in Santo Domingo. As there were no health personnel on duty, it was necessary to call 911. Security agents prevented the paramedics from entering because they did not have authorisation from their supervisors. After 25 minutes of complaints from the workers, they could finally enter, but it was too late.\n\n&gt; Between the time of death and approximately 1 am the following day, Luis Pimentel’s limp body remained at the site. During this time, managers and supervisors forced his colleagues to continue operations until the body was finally removed. It is more important to exploit workers and make profits at their expense regardless of anything else, neither their life nor their death.\n\nIt\'s like those billionaire pricks have some kind of twisted club in which they try to outdo each other. I can definitely picture the ugly fossilized face of daniel julien (who looks suspiciously like Kock bros, not surprised if the dickheads are related) smirking at Jeff Bezos: ""Pff you got flak for making your slaves pee in bottles? Look at me, I made them work next to the dead body of their brethren and no one bat an eye"". Totally plausible.\n\nFinally, there is a reason I write teleperformance and daniel julien without capitalization. In my mother tongue, capitalizing proper nouns is a acknowlegement of uniqueness and respect. I refuse to acknowledge that for these low-life\'s. Rot in hell, and I hope you choke on whatever the fuck you\'re eating, teleperformance managers.', 'can someone explain why the camera needs to be on?', 'Can confirm this method.

That sounds horrifying.\n\nEdit: I should mention that everyone I worked with showed genuine concern for each other\'s wellbeing. It was one of the most compassionate and understanding work environments I\'ve ever experienced.', 'Here’s the whole article without ads:\n\nModerator Who Watched Hours of Traumatic Videos Sues TikTok for Failing to Protect Her Mental Health\nThe former content moderator says she has developed panic attacks and depression. She also has a hard time sleeping and experiences horrific nightmares.\nByJody Serrano\nToday 12:23AM\n\nA former content moderator for TikTok is suing the social media giant and its parent company, ByteDance, for reportedly failing to take measures to protect her mental health after she watched countless hours of traumatic videos involving cannibalism, rapes, animal mutilation, and suicides, among numerous other disturbing activities.\n\nIn the proposed class action lawsuit, Candie Frazier, who worked for a third-party contracting firm, stated that TikTok moderators work at a grueling pace and are obligated to review hundreds of videos per day with few breaks, according to Bloomberg. Moderators work 12-hour shifts, Frazier explained, and only get one hour off for lunch and two 15-minute breaks.\nDespite the long shifts, moderators often have to watch multiple videos at once, ranging from three to 10, and only review 25 seconds of each video, she said. ByteDance keeps a close eye on the moderators’ performance, the Verge reported, and “heavily punishes any time taken away from watching graphic videos.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that TikTok has not adhered to industry standards to protect content moderators, which include offering them frequent breaks and psychological support, the Verge explained. Frazier also claims thatTikTok has failed to implement technical safeguards, such as blurring or reducing the resolution of videos moderators have to watch.\n\nBecause of her work as a content moderator, Frazier said she has developed panic attacks and depression as well as symptoms associated with anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. She also has trouble sleeping and suffers from horrible nightmares when she does manage to sleep over the content she’s watched.\n\nFrazier is seeking to have TikTok pay her and others for the psychological injuries they have suffered. In addition, she wants the court to force the company to set up a medical fund for content moderators.\nGizmodo reached out to TikTok for comment on the lawsuit on Sunday but did not receive a response by the time of publication. We’ll make sure to update this article if we hear back.\n\nIn a recent statement to Bloomberg, a spokesperson for the social media giant said it doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation. However, TikTok works hard “to promote a caring working environment for our employees and contractors.”\n\n“Our safety team partners with third party firms on the critical work of helping to protect the TikTok platform and community, and we continue to expand on a range of wellness services so that moderators feel supported mentally and emotionally,” the spokesperson said.', 'Damn I never thought about what it takes to keep horrific content off these platforms. \n\nI used to work graphics at CNN and can relate to having to be the censor. some of the images i’ve seen have stuck with me. Bombing victims, plane crashes, cartel murders… I actively worked to protect myself when I could but I was often the person to blur or crop these types of things.\n\nNow with people Trying to upload disturbing stuff for shock value… I could never.']"

The way you combat this type of misuse and invasion of privacy is fairly straightforward:\n\n* All electronic records systems must have audit capabilities.  In medicine, this is required under HIPAA.\n* Perform targeted audits over high profile cases.  \n* Perform random audits with enough frequency to potentially review all staff with access on an annual basis\n* Transparently conduct audits for any and all complaints of misuse \n* The most important: Have a zero tolerance policy.\n\nThis type of approach is not perfect, but it puts enough negative pressure on the problem to really make staff think twice before entering the record of someone they shouldn't.\n\nSource: I am Chief Medical Officer of a health system.\n\nEdit: grammar \n\nEdit 2: spelling\n\nEdit 3:  I should clarify how our process works internally.  The audit starts with a collection of information from the system itself.  This information is reviewed by the manager of that employee to determine if the access was appropriate or not.  If they do not feel it was appropriate, then the manager would conduct an investigation.  If the outcome of this investigation (including an interview of the employee) was that the record was accessed inappropriately (not accidentally), then the zero tolerance policy comes into effect.  Having done this type of investigation several times myself, it is fairly apparent which breaches are the real deal.\n\nEdit 4:  I generally do not like zero tolerance policies.  They can be abused and can result in casualties (as some commenters have suggested.

While the results were encouraging, that was a small study with just 40 participants in a highly controlled setting.\n\nThe latest study involved 164 healthcare workers in Sweden who worked with COVID-19 patients, and were exposed to work-related trauma. It was conducted during the pandemic, between September 2020 and April 2022.\n\nThe results were remarkable. At a five-week follow-up with the participants – who experienced 15 flashbacks a week on average – those in the control group who only listened to the radio for treatment reported an average of five episodes a week, while those in the gaming group had just one.\n\nThe experimental group that played Tetris also reported only half as many flashbacks six months after their treatment than the control group."", 'Tetris used to help me with my PTSD because there is nothing really unpredictable about it.

Why the 60 days bullshit?', 'Canada has this! Every phone is sold unlocked by law.', 'From the article: The FCC wants to make it significantly easier for consumers to unlock their phones from their carriers, proposing that all devices must be unlockable just 60 days after purchase. How this will mesh with current plans and phone-buying trends, however, is something the agency is hoping to learn before putting such a rule into effect.\n\nMobile phones purchased from a carrier are generally locked to that carrier until either the contract is up or the phone is paid off. But despite improvements to the process over the years (unlocking was flat-out illegal not long ago), it still isn’t quite clear to all consumers when and how they can unlock their phone and take it to the carrier (or country) of their choice.\n\nTo be clear, this is not about opening up your phone using a face, fingerprint or password, but changing settings in its software to allow it to work with different mobile networks.\n\nFCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel announced the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, in a press release Thursday. “When you buy a phone, you should have the freedom to decide when to change service to the carrier you want and not have the device you own stuck by practices that prevent you from making that choice,” she wrote. “That is why we are proposing clear, nationwide mobile phone unlocking rules.”\n\nSpecifically, the release says, carriers would simply have to provide unlocking services 60 days after activation. A welcome standard, but it may run afoul of today’s phone and wireless markets.']"

It\'s a shitty op-ed piece with no tests, no data, just some casual observations and anecdotes about browser tabs and their own usage intermingled with throw-away quotes from Apple sales people. OMG, the sales person says the company\'s product is fine!? Fire up your blog engines, because the world needs to hear this!\n\nLook, there\'s no fucking way I\'m buying a Mac with 8 GB of RAM. I don\'t recommend them either. But where is the performance data? Do some actual testing. Browser automation libraries aren\'t hard to come by. Chrome has tons of instrumentation that will let you automate the process of opening browser tabs, navigating web pages, completing web forms, and will give you render times. All of this could be compiled into a meaningful test of the performance delta for a ""light tasks"" test cycle.\n\nNo one does that though. They just whine and complain about the number on the box.\n\nAnecdotally, I know three people who have 8GB Apple Silicon laptops. They came to me because someone told them I\'m the ""computer guy"", and they wanted to know how to do various things.\n\nOne wanted to know how to get their photos on their computer, so I showed them the Photos app. They were already signed into iCloud, so their photos just started showing up. They were blown away.\n\nAnother said that their grandson told them they could Facetime from their computer, and they were very excited about the prospect of being able to do video calls with their grandkids. So I showed them how to use Facetime.\n\nThe third had lost their email password and wanted help getting back into their account. I showed them how to use iCloud Keychain.\n\nI habitually check the ""About this Mac"" option on any Mac I touch, just so I know what I\'m working with. None of these people had any idea how much RAM their systems had. All of them said they loved how fast their new computer is.\n\nI know it\'s really hard for enthusiasts to grasp the concept, but 8 GB of RAM really is ""enough"" for a lot of people. Browsers will deactivate tabs that do not have focus. The system will use up all the RAM available to it — up to a point — so if you have a system with ≥16 GB of RAM, you can\'t simply look at your utilization and infer that all systems will require the same for a given work load. If a system with a fast SSD has to live within a constrained amount of memory, performance will suffer, but it will not be the same as the old days when we were living with spinning platters.\n\nTo be clear, I am not advocating for systems with 8 GB of RAM. Like I said, I wouldn\'t buy one, and I wouldn\'t recommend one. But I do see people using them, and those people don\'t seem to have many complaints. I\'m not about to tell them that they should feel bad about a computing choice that works just great for them, and neither should PC Gamer.\n\nThe people who buy 8 GB Macs are buying an appliance.

This would be ideal because USB-C powered docks can come with you can you can just use your Macbook charger to power them. I hope to see more of these in the future.\n\n- 5Gb/s Ethernet is above average, most ship only 2.5Gb/s to claim multi-gig speeds. It will be interesting to know if this is connected via USB or PCIe or both depending on the host. PCIe results in lower overheads.\n\n- PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD - if this chipset (presumably JHL9440 Barlow Ridge but the details do not appear to be on [ark.intel.com](http://ark.intel.com) yet) is like the JHL8440, it probably only has a single PCIe lane unfortunately, but at least the bandwidth will be double because of PCIe Gen4 vs Gen3.\n\n- Triple 4K 144Hz is standard for Thunderbolt 5, but it will depend on the host. And the new Macs when they bring support for USB4v2 (which Thunderbolt 5 uses as the underlying technology) will likely (based on past behaviour by Apple) not support all the displays. The M-series base chips only drove the laptop\'s display and one external, except the M3 which received a firmware update enabling two external monitors but only when the laptop\'s lid is closed. Either way, unless Apple increases the number of display streams available on their base chips, they will not be permitted by Intel to use Thunderbolt 5 branding. This leads to a mess where they might call the ports Thunderbolt 3 (40Gb/s) with USB4v2 (80Gb/s). I hope this can convince Apple to just enable more displays with M4 chips, but they probably do not want to because it forces professionals to buy the more expensive M Pro and M Max chips.', 'Wondering on the backwards compatibility of this.  Don’t need all that video pass through- I (only?) run 2 X 4K 60hz anyhow, but that all the docks right now are 1 or 2.5 g only has me plugging in a separate 10g adapter right now which runs super hot.  5g would be enough for me to not need that (my storage only touches 6g anyway).\nEdit to add my clients are current base M3 MacBook Pro, and the final Intel MacBook Pro with the 8g GPU.', 'Jesus, what a beast.']"

Yes, this has the potential to be serious but the set of circumstances are actually quite narrow and the scope of any data leak in the CPU is, well, pretty unpredictable.\n\nAlso, Intel has a track record of prioritising profits above everything else. Their frivolous lawsuit against AMD which they ultimately lost was also a huge bit of corporate genius as the payout to AMD paled in comparison to the profits they made in the process, and left AMD trailing for years. The mitigation for this vulnerability would have severely crippled Intel\'s prized features, speculative execution and branch prediction, the two areas where their CPUs have traditionally gained an edge over their competitors silicon.\n\nI don\'t condone it, but I can understand why Intel was keen to keep this buried, as it would have nobbled their CPUs right at the time when Ryzen and particularly Threadripper was finally proving a serious threat to over a decade of Intel dominance in the enthusiast and gaming market.\n\nThose people crying ""conspiracy theory"" are likely not wrong that it was a conspiracy, but of the corporate and legal type, rather than the secret squirrel government type. Intel was more than likely simply focused on its bottom line above all else.\n\nI\'ll also draw attention to the entire car crash that was NetBurst, and again Intel plugged on for years trying to bury the problems, albeit not with a vulnerability but just with an incredibly bad architecture that had many flaws and was being pushed well beyond its realistic performance ceiling to try and outpace AMD.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gadgets) if you have any questions or concerns.*', 'The comments here are absolutely awful. Good god. I’ll try to add something meaningful.\n\nThe AppleInsider article has managed to cherry-pick probably the least interesting or meaningful finding from [the original study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37769610/). The authors provide it essentially as an aside, since they did actually measure it but it didn’t meaningfully explain any other finding.\n\nHere are some findings that actually did matter:\n\n- atrial fibrillation can be challenging to diagnose, and accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) improve with both experience over a career and experience with a set task. Consultant cardiologists were far better at it than medical students, as you’d expect, but they also did better on the last five ECGs in a set compared to the first five.\n- there was no meaningful difference between different devices at the chance of accurately diagnosing atrial fibrillation\n- despite this, the participants *subjectively* preferred the data presentation from the Apple Watch although this didn’t actually make them perform any better at the task at hand.\n\nTo expand on this last point, the original study reads:\n\n“No significant difference in the accuracy of atrial fibrillation detection was seen between the five smart devices; p = 0.33. SL-ECGs from the Apple Watch were considered as having the best quality and readability by 203 (45%) and 226 (50%) participants, respectively.”\n\nTo boil that down: people thought that the Apple Watch gave the best data, but that *did not translate into better performance at diagnosing AF*. Not only was there no significant difference, a p-value of 0.33 means that the results were *extremely* clear that there’s no best device for this purpose.\n\nAppleInsider has managed, ironically, to take a finding that’s purely about user experience and blow it out of proportion when the authors themselves explicitly say it doesn’t matter to the primary outcome of a patient receiving an accurate diagnosis. There’s a joke in there somewhere, but I’m not going to make it.\n\nI have plenty of my own Apple products and I have no horse in this race, but awful science journalism really annoys me.']"

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in his Power On newsletter that the company is looking at these options as ways to bring the cost down to between $1,500 and $2,500 for a lower-end model. Apple Vision Pro, which is set to begin shipping in early 2024, currently starts at an eye-watering $3,500.\n\nIn an earlier report, Gurman said the cheaper Vision Pro would also use lower resolution displays inside the headset. The big indication now is that it may drop the external display that enables its signature EyeSight feature, according to Gurman. EyeSight projects the wearer’s eyes onto an outward-facing OLED display so anyone who approaches can see where their attention is focused. It was one of major selling points in Apple's Vision Pro announcement, though it isn’t exactly mission critical.\n\nAccording to Gurman, a follow-up to the premium Vision Pro is in the works already, too. That will have EyeSight, and potentially a more lightweight design that opts for built-in prescription lenses for those who need it rather than the Zeiss inserts it’s working with now.""]"

Icue itself for headset constantly reset my settings on restart until I reinstalled and registry wiped all traces of it, something that Corsair itself recommends.\nTheir lights have... Issues remembering your settings when turned on.\n\nYou'll definitely want equalizer since frequency response will need some changing. You do get adobe Atmos though and that's a good feature especially for fps where 3d sounds matters.\n\nThe volume wheel sticks out and if I lean back into my headrest it will actuate.\n\nMy battery life isn't 18 hrs. If you're actively using it all day 13 is about right. I can totally believe it's improved on the premium model though as this is a common complaint. You can use it while charging.\n\nThe best thing about the hs80s is the mic is almost as good as the virtuoso, which has the best mic I've ever used on a headset. It's not broadcast quality but it's honestly close.\n\nI got my hs80s for $90 and for that price I'm ok with it.\n\n Hard to imagine paying $180 for these. Grabem on sale or if you can tolerate less comfort the virtuoso is better. If you want comfort steel series is what your after, their headband is noticeably better than the hs80s (more comfortable material).\n\nEdit: according to Corsair. Triple battery life (64hrs). Changes to buttons, Bluetooth, soundid. \n\nTriple battery life is big and tripling the actual battery life of the hs80s being  that's still 36hrs.\n\nStill not worth $180 imo but at $140 maybe."", 'Below average bass, treble, and mids for headsets in that price bracket.

Although Apple stopped shipping the accessory for free with iPhone 12, the company also updated iPhone 11 with a new, more compact box without the charger.\n\nAfter the iPhones were seized, Apple Brazil requested the government to allow sales of the smartphone in the country until the final decision of the dispute.

cl31og,RIP Headphone Jack: how the industry created and killed the world's most popular port,,1564746466.0,gadgets,"[""I really hate that nobody is talking about the fatigue using a dongle for audio puts on the USB C port. The 3.5mm Jack is fairly robust, usually ~2mm thick steel with pretty positive detent locking.\n\nUsb C ports just aren't meant for the kind of abuse that a headphone jack can take while commuting, working out etc. Plus if you break your 3.5mm the phone is still fairly functional, if you ruin the USB-C you're fucked.\n\nEdit: This really blew up! To everyone suggesting Bluetooth, I'm of course aware I could buy Bluetooth headphones but a phone is perfectly capable of driving low-impedence audiophile grade headphones which I've already invested hundreds of dollars in. I also refuse to spend substantial amounts of money on headphones with an integrated, non-replaceable battery which will render them obsolete in a few years. I buy good headphones with replaceable cables and keep them for 10+ years. My EDC solution is a little battery powered Bluetooth receiver DAC/amp that looks like a usb stick with a headphone jack in the end. My unit of choice is a FiiO BTR1K, has no problem driving a 50 ohm pair of Sennheiser HD58x or any IEM and has aptx codec support."", 'apple should fuck around and reintroduce the jack']"

Electrically powered micro-motors offer advantages, such as selective cargo loading, transport and release and the ability to use electricity to “deform” cells, but they have some downsides. So, combining the two was a no-brainer.\n\n“The micro-robots that have operated until now based on an electrical guiding mechanism were not effective in certain environments characterized by relatively high electrical conductivity, such as a physiological environment, where the electric drive is less effective,” said Gilad Yossifon, corresponding author of the study. “This is where the complementary magnetic mechanism comes into play, which is very effective regardless of the electrical conductivity of the environment.”\n\nOnce the hybrid propulsion system was assembled, researchers were able to demonstrate the micro-robot’s capabilities. They used it to capture a single red blood cell, cancer cells, and a single bacterium, demonstrating that the micro-robot could distinguish between a healthy cell and one that had been damaged by a drug or a dying cell and one that was undergoing a natural “suicide” process (apoptosis). Once captured, the cell can be moved to an external instrument for further analysis.\n\nBut, the advantage of the hybrid micro-robot is that it can also capture non-labeled cells by sensing their status. This is the first study to undertake micro-robot-based sensing of label-free apoptotic cells.\n\n[Study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202204931)']"

Thunderbolt would be used for external PCI SSD RAID. \n\n - USB 3 would be used for game controllers. Thunderbolt would be used for VR headsets.\n\n - USB 3 would be used for a few digital instruments.

144ffjp,/r/Gadgets will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit's new API policy,"###What's Going On? 

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

###What's The Plan?

On June 12th, [*many subreddits*](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable\nthan it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on\nuncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact \nboth groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; \nwithout the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting \ncreativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an \never-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit – the fixtures which make it\nappealing – will be eliminated.\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has\nallowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not\ntacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no \nthought to what may come afterward.

They are worse.~~\n\n~~Anker have deliberately pegged back the power output compared to normal PD devices (like their 26800 PD). The normal ones output 9V/3A or 15V/2A. The Switch branded ones have been turned down to 9V/2.4A or 15V/1.6A.~~\n\n~~The Switch has an issue in that\'s it\'s not fully compliant of the USB-C power standards (I don\'t know the full details but there\'s loads of info online), the result being that it can, if the charger provides it, pull way to much power and brick itself. So plugging in high powered USB-C chargers like those from Macbooks is a flat out bad idea. Don\'t do it.~~\n\n~~So this isn\'t just an overpriced rebrand of an existing product (like the SD cards), it\'s also been deliberately made worse than its base product, presumably to ensure that the maximum power it can ever deliver is well under the safe limits for the Switch and ensure it won\'t inadvertently damage anyone\'s console. It means that while this might be the safest PD battery bank for your Switch, it\'s going to be slower at charging anything else you plug into the PD port.~~']"

Scrolled and got redirected to ad site.\n\nAaaaand I won't read further. Fuck that ads!"", 'Here\'s the full article. For those who are facing problems because of the ads. \n\n&gt; iPhone 8 Is World\'s Fastest Phone (It\'s Not Even Close)\n\n\n\n&gt; The ""Bionic"" part in the name of Apple\'s A11 Bionic chip isn\'t just marketing speak. It\'s the most powerful processor ever put in a mobile phone. We\'ve put this chip to the test in both synthetic benchmarks and some real-world speed trials, and it obliterates every Android phone we tested.\n\n&gt; As a quick primer, the A11 Bionic is a six-core CPU, with two performance cores that promise a 25-percent boost in performance and four high-efficiency cores that promise up to a 70-percent improvement over the iPhone 7\'s A10 Fusion chip. Last but not least is an Apple-designed GPU that\'s supposed to be 30 percent faster than before.\n\n&gt; Let\'s start with Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance. On the multicore portion of this test, the iPhone 8 hit 10,170. That\'s 54 percent faster than the score from Samsung\'s Galaxy Note 8 — currently the fastest Android phone.\n\n&gt; The Android competition wasn\'t close. The Note 8 scored 6,564, and that\'s with an impressive 6GB of RAM paired with Qualcomm\'s fast Snapdragon 835 chip. How about the OnePlus 5 and its 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 835? That handset got 6,542. With 4GB of RAM, the Galaxy S8 scored 6,295 with the same processor.\n\n&gt; The iPhone 8 even edged out the score from the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro with a 7th-generation Core i5 processor. That notebook notched 9,213. Is Geekbench 4 really comparable from phone to desktop? According to the founder of Geekbench, John Poole, “the short is answer is yes that the scores are comparable across platforms, so if an iPhone 8 scores higher than an i5, then the iPhone 8 is faster than the i5.”\n\n&gt; However, Poole provided the important caveat that laptops are better at delivering sustained performance over a longer period of time, as opposed to the shorter max burst performance that benchmarks like Geekbench 4 are designed to measure. In other words, the iPhone 8 simply doesn’t have the thermals and heat dissipation necessary to replace your laptop.\n\n&gt; Next up is 3DMark, which gauges graphics performance. The iPhone 8 scored an off-the-charts 62,212, and the iPhone 8 Plus managed an even higher 64,412. Compare that to the Note 8\'s 39,834 and the OnePlus 5\'s 39,576.\n\n&gt; If you\'re wondering how all this translates to real-world performance, we have more good news for iPhone 8 shoppers — and bad news for everyone else. To really put the A11 Bionic chip through its paces, we put the same 2-minute video, shot in 4K by a drone, on the iPhone 8, Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8+, and then added the same transitions and effects before exporting and saving the video.\n\n&gt; The iPhone 8 finished this strenuous task in just 42 seconds, while the Note 8 took more than 3 minutes. The Galaxy S8+ took more than 4 minutes.\n\n&gt; The iPhone 8 also opened more demanding apps faster than its predecessor and the top Android phone right now, although those differences were less dramatic. It took the iPhone 8 11 seconds to fully load the Injustice 2 game, compared to 14.53 seconds for the iPhone 7 Plus and 19 seconds for the Note 8.\n\n&gt; Of course, there are lots of ways to measure performance, but based on our preliminary testing, the iPhone 8 is easily the fastest phone ever. Now everyone else has to play catchup.']"

wq211c,Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids Are Finally on the Way | The FDA's finalized regulations will allow hearing aids to be sold without a prescription in U.S. stores as early as mid-October.,,1660675253.0,gadgets,"[""Hi, Audiologist here! So this is really exciting because it will hopefully lead to more people being able to afford hearing aids, though there are a few things I've picked up on while keeping up with the OTC Hearing Aid saga:\n\n1. Prior to 2017, the FDA had two categories for assistive listening devices: Hearing Aids and Personal Sound Amplifiers. The big thing the 2017 bill did was lump all assistive listening devices into the Hearing Aid category. So rather than make actual medical-grade hearing aids (the ones audiologists like myself prescribe and program based on an individual's audiogram) more affordable, it really just allowed cheaper personal amplifiers to rebrand as hearing aids.\n2. The FDA states in their dossier that the OTC hearing aids are intended for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. So those with more severe hearing losses will probably find pretty limited benefit from these OTC hearing aids and may need something a bit more powerful.\n3. Some of the OTC hearing aids are not programmable (basically acting as plain old amplifiers) while others are programmable via a smartphone app. These programmable ones give you a lot more flexibility with the sound quality, but [how accurately these are programmed](https://journals.lww.com/ear-hearing/Abstract/2019/07000/Factors_Associated_With_Successful_Setup_of_a.4.aspx) can vary. We also have to take into account that many people that need hearing aids may not be tech-savy enough to program them appropriately.\n4. A **lot** of the patients I see in my clinic come in thinking they have hearing loss and need hearing aids, when in fact it's a more transient issue like impacted ear wax or middle ear effusion, or it's something more serious like a [sudden sensorineural hearing loss](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/sudden-deafness) that requires quick medical intervention rather than just throwing a hearing aid on that ear.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a great thing! Insurances very rarely cover hearing aids, and hearing aid manufacturers love their profit margins, so there are a lot of us who can't just afford a pair of hearing aids even though we may truly need them. This will help a lot of people, but it's important to keep in mind that it's not actually fixing the root problem. Until we begin to require Medicare to cover hearing aids, or at least find a way to curtail the cost hearing aid manufacturers charge clinic's like mine for their devices, hearing aids won't actually get that much cheaper."", ""Now Do CPAP's. The fact someone can't buy a fan to blow air up their nose is stupid. Not to mention the cost."", 'There’s a lot of expertise that goes into hearing aids, though — the one I have took a custom earmold (which can be done at a pharmacy). BUT. It also required hearing tests in a specialized soundproof booth, interpretations of that, and then a pretty decent amount of tuning by an audiology doctor. \n\nHearing loss isn’t usually _all of your hearing is gone by the same amount across the whole frequency range_, rather there’s specific points where hearing loss is worse. \n\nSeems to me like hearing aids without the customization would just be like standing next to a loud stereo.']"

Bravo.  Nice to see some forward thinking from an industry vendor using Python.  (While EV3 eventually supported Python, it wasn\'t native, out of the box, or easy)  While I appreciated LEGO\'s attempt at block-based programming, Scratch is simpler and more widely adopted.\n* ***Price Point:*** The EV3 Kit was $470 at the end.  This kit is $360.  That\'s a pretty significant change, and I imagine motivated in no small part by VEX and Arduino-based price points for educational products.  Mindstorms is no longer the only game in town like they were 10-15 years ago, and as a result they can\'t command as much of a premium on price.\n* ***Pieces:*** - The EV3 Kit (More expensive, mind you) came with 541 pieces.  The new set comes with 950, at a lower price point.  That\'s amazing.  To get to that many pieces, you had to fork over another $250 for the EV3 expansion set, previously.  This is a net positive for builders out there.\n* ***Peripherals:*** 4 Medium Motors in the base kit compared to EV3\'s 2 Large, 1 Medium.  Jury\'s out on how force output will compare between the new set\'s \'medium\' motors and the old set\'s \'large\' motors, but from a teacher perspective, I value more motors over motor force, and at this price point, purchasing extra motors isn\'t as much of a concern.\n* ***Color:***  Not gonna lie - that Teal is pretty nice.\n* ***Battery Connector:*** Long the bane of teachers - perfectly working battery with broken connector clips.  They\'ve considerably strengthened the battery clips, and made the battery easier to attach/detach as well as charge while connected to the bot by changing the charging cable to use the same Micro USB as the data port.\n* ***4 Wheels in Base Kit:*** This doesn\'t sound huge, but it is.  Will never understand why the EV3 kit only came with 2 large wheels.\n* ***Improved Color Sensor:*** It appears the color sensor has been given a refresh and upgraded its own light generation ability, so that it is less dependent on ambient light conditions.  Nice!\n\n***Cons:***\n\n* ***No on-device display:*** This is a tough pill to swallow.  This no doubt saved cost and development work.  This removed several key abilities that I used as a teacher with my students, the first being the ability to store multiple programs and run multiple programs.  Now you must have an additional Bluetooth device paired to perform this. (And I can\'t even begin to explain to you how tedious it is to teach and manage 5th grade students in pairing bluetooth devices, not to mention the obnoxiousness involved when you begin to use student devices IE: Phones instead of classroom devices)  This is a considerable expense for most classrooms.  Second, it prevents any ability to interact with the sensors of the device.  Often in educating my students about light sensors, encoders, ultrasonic, we would use the display to show the \'reading\' the sensor was recording, to help them understand data and sensing.  This ability is now completely lost, at a *considerable* detriment.  Lastly, it removes an important diagnostic element from troubleshooting these devices.\n* ***Technic Elements:*** While they have yet to release a full element list, it appears the 51515 comes with considerably fewer long technic pieces (11, 13, and 15 hole).  As a teacher, this greatly constrains students from making \'large\' builds, and is a surprise considering it comes with 950 elements.  Looking at pictures, many of these elements are tiny \'cosmetic\' elements.  Kit will likely need some supplemental parts to do more ambitious projects.\n* ***Built In Gyro/Accelerometer?:*** I\'m putting this one in the con list to start, but this could be a pro.  The new 51515 reduced the I/O ports from 8 to 6, but in return, the Accelerometer/Gyroscope is now internal to the device.  If the Accelerometer/Gyro work well, this is roughly a wash, in my opinion, considering the infrared and color sensor have now been completely consolidated into one sensor.  However, the Accelerometer/Gyro was the #1 sensor to break in my EV3 kits, so it worries me - if it breaks in this kit, I have to purchase an entirely new hub to the tune of $100+.\n\nOverall I\'m pretty excited to see this.  I was tremendously concerned last year that LEGO was using its ""SPIKE Prime"" kit to replace EV3, as it was enormously feature and element lacking.  Seeing now that this product is geared towards the very young, its nice to see a new product for late Elementary / Middle School students.', 'Is it typical for frontpage /r/gadgets posts to be devoid of comments']"

Its iconic Chatter Telephone has been enjoyed by toddlers for 60 years now, and to celebrate that anniversary, Mattel has turned the toy into a fully-functional smartphone accessory that can actually be used to place or take phone calls.\n\nReferring to this as the Chatter Telephone 2.0 isn’t entirely accurate. Over the last 60 years the toy has undergone countless revisions and updates both to make it safer for kids to play with and also to update its appearance. The play pattern, however, has essentially stayed exactly the same over the past six decades. It rolls, its eyes move, the numbered rotary dial can spin, and traditionally it’s been powered by imagination. But this new version swaps imagination for Bluetooth and rechargeable batteries.\n\nThe upgraded Chatter Telephone connects to a smartphone over Bluetooth, so the rotary dial can actually be used to place calls by dialing the person’s phone number, digit by digit (which is something most of us will probably have to look up in our phone’s contact list). When a call comes in it can be answered by simply picking up the Chatter Telephone’s red handset and talking into it, or by pressing the speakerphone button on the toy, which is the only real indication that this version is different from the toy.']"

14r106y,NASA restores contact with Mars helicopter after nine weeks of silence,,1688534250.0,gadgets,"['\nOn July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party\napplications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications (which include\nbrowsers like Reddit Is Fun, moderation tools like Pushshift, and accessibility-focused add-ons for users who are visually\nimpaired) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable\nthan it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on\nuncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact \nboth groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; \nwithout the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting \ncreativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an \never-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit – the fixtures which make it\nappealing – will be eliminated.\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has\nallowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not\ntacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no \nthought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman\'s statement – ""I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our\nshareholders to be users"" – is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote:\n\nAllow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.\n\nAllow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
